l6ub9l	0	19	THIS IS THE MOMENT.
l6ub9l	1	16	Life isn't fair.
l6ub9l	2	78	My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment.
l6ub9l	3	61	I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them.
l6ub9l	4	77	When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation.
l6ub9l	5	47	"\"Are you going to let them get away with this\"?"
l6ub9l	6	18	"\"Life isn't fair\"."
l6ub9l	7	14	No, it is not.
l6ub9l	8	21	The game is the game.
l6ub9l	9	7	Always.
l6ub9l	10	43	In this moment, the fascade cracks further.
l6ub9l	11	97	When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands.
l6ub9l	12	9	Millions.
l6ub9l	13	98	Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled.
l6ub9l	14	60	The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath.
l6ub9l	15	81	They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying.
l6ub9l	16	32	They told us that we were naive.
l6ub9l	17	36	We needed networks to be successful.
l6ub9l	18	17	We needed polish.
l6ub9l	19	20	We needed expertise.
l6ub9l	20	15	We needed THEM.
l6ub9l	21	21	The game is the game.
l6ub9l	22	7	Always.
l6ub9l	23	28	They are no longer laughing.
l6ub9l	24	48	Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air.
l6ub9l	25	92	While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition.
l6ub9l	26	37	Something all together disconcerting.
l6ub9l	27	25	What it betrays, is fear.
l6ub9l	28	16	They are afraid.
l6ub9l	29	19	And they should be.
l6ub9l	30	58	We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen.
l6ub9l	31	16	A new day dawns.
l6ub9l	32	77	The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most.
l6ub9l	33	14	An even field.
l6ub9l	34	40	Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.
l6ub9l	35	4	AND.
l6ub9l	36	5	THEY.
l6ub9l	37	4	ARE.
l6ub9l	38	7	SCARED.
l6ub9l	39	34	They look at us and see roughness.
l6ub9l	40	33	We look at them and see softness.
l6ub9l	41	38	We are both correct in our estimation.
l6ub9l	42	21	The game is the game.
l6ub9l	43	7	Always.
l6ub9l	44	24	Fuck them in the street.
l6ub9l	45	28	Fuck them all in the street.
l6ub9l	46	21	We are the righteous.
l6ub9l	47	25	We are blessed by Phoebe.
l6ub9l	48	61	What started here will echo through time in the eons to come.
l6ub9l	49	82	Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament.
l6ub9l	50	63	May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face.
l6ub9l	51	70	And may the wings of destiny carry you aloft, to dance with the stars.
l6ub9l	52	29	GME everything BB everything.
l6ub4i	0	31	Currently Holding AMC and NOK .
l6ub4i	1	62	Is it retarded that I think I should move it all to GME today?

l6s7lo	1	21	thank you everyone!!!
l6rmkl	0	26	We need to talk about NOK.
l6rmkl	1	28	I get it, it's not the play.
l6rmkl	2	29	I'm not saying sell your GME.
l6rmkl	3	48	I'm not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole.
l6rmkl	4	165	I'm a regular guy who's got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young.
l6rmkl	5	40	If you don't agree with me, just say so.
l6rmkl	6	79	I'm also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.
l6rmkl	7	56	But, BUT, yesterday we did something they've never seen.
l6rmkl	8	46	Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares.
l6rmkl	9	74	That's what that big spike was, and that's why trading was stopped for 2h.
l6rmkl	10	110	If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history.
l6rmkl	11	54	Because they will keep dumping it until it's too late.
l6rmkl	12	20	Impossible, you say.
l6rmkl	13	25	Too many shares, you say.
l6rmkl	14	15	Well listen up.
l6rmkl	15	81	Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia.
l6rmkl	16	49	That is 1 5 of all the Nokia shares in the world.
l6rmkl	17	29	That's never happened, EVER .
l6rmkl	18	63	Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.
l6rmkl	19	35	3516.16% of average trading volume.
l6rmkl	20	14	Do you get it?
l6rmkl	21	130	They'll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won't be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in.
l6rmkl	22	32	We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY.
l6rmkl	23	8	ONE DAY.
l6rmkl	24	33	Why do they stop trading in NYSE?
l6rmkl	25	93	"Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don't want \"artificial\" spikes in the prices."
l6rmkl	26	179	So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again.
l6rmkl	27	55	That's why that spike went down right after the freeze.
l6rmkl	28	25	But then we did it again.
l6rmkl	29	27	And they had to stop again.
l6rmkl	30	32	The price just wouldn't go down.
l6rmkl	31	117	The assholes who'd just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who'd convinced them.
l6rmkl	32	24	Everyone is watching us.
l6rmkl	33	94	What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.
l6rmkl	34	32	What did the asshole brigade do?
l6rmkl	35	26	They started shorting NOK.
l6rmkl	36	82	They will continue to do that, because they think we're retards they are correct .
l6rmkl	37	38	But how come the price didn't go down?
l6rmkl	38	67	It's got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it.
l6rmkl	39	77	How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there?
l6rmkl	40	27	How is this going to work?.
l6rmkl	41	41	Because the retard brigade was buying it.
l6rmkl	42	30	There's 3m of us and counting.
l6rmkl	43	75	If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that's 300m shares.
l6rmkl	44	46	Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it.
l6rmkl	45	4	AND.
l6rmkl	46	8	FUCKING.
l6rmkl	47	5	HOLD.
l6rmkl	48	36	And every dip you see, you buy more.
l6rmkl	49	4	AND.
l6rmkl	50	8	FUCKING.
l6rmkl	51	5	HOLD.
l6rmkl	52	84	They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down.
l6rmkl	53	68	Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK.
l6rmkl	54	17	Price skyrockets.
l6rmkl	55	38	And normies outside were following us.
l6rmkl	56	58	They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016.
l6rmkl	57	72	This means they don't think it's a bubble that's going to crash on them.
l6rmkl	58	56	So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME?
l6rmkl	59	25	I'm not saying sell GME .
l6rmkl	60	63	Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now.
l6rmkl	61	81	That scares a normal guy who's just trying to put in some savings for his family.
l6rmkl	62	48	They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.
l6rmkl	63	16	Not so with NOK.
l6rmkl	64	64	Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still DOWN from 2016.
l6rmkl	65	14	Remember 2016?
l6rmkl	66	48	Remember that being a really big year for Nokia?
l6rmkl	67	15	No, me neither.
l6rmkl	68	64	And let's not even get started on where it has been in the past.
l6rmkl	69	44	Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.
l6rmkl	70	40	You know what is going to be a big year?
l6rmkl	71	14	2021 and 2022.
l6rmkl	72	5	Why?.
l6rmkl	73	32	What else did NOK say yesterday?
l6rmkl	74	121	Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I'm not a techie.
l6rmkl	75	64	But it IS a new kind of technology that's going to kick 5Gs ass.
l6rmkl	76	128	And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade Do you think we're going to need more data this year than last year?.
l6rmkl	77	137	Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn't handle the amount people were streaming?
l6rmkl	78	72	What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?.
l6rmkl	79	33	But why would NOK be the company?
l6rmkl	80	38	Well, remember the 5G war with China?.
l6rmkl	81	75	US and Europe can't buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks.
l6rmkl	82	45	But guess who US and Europe aren't afraid of?
l6rmkl	83	16	Fucking FINLAND.
l6rmkl	84	27	Finland, the land of NOKIA.
l6rmkl	85	97	So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn't really exist.
l6rmkl	86	52	Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you.
l6rmkl	87	140	Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.
l6rmkl	88	11	Want proof?
l6rmkl	89	53	They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON .
l6rmkl	90	35	And we're going to send them there.
l6rmkl	91	68	But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it's so great?.
l6rmkl	92	37	Answer because Microsoft fucked them.
l6rmkl	93	165	That's right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company.
l6rmkl	94	141	These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college.
l6rmkl	95	66	Imagine everyone who'd be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.
l6rmkl	96	20	Worked like a charm.
l6rmkl	97	9	Firesale.
l6rmkl	98	23	Business restructuring.
l6rmkl	99	18	Lost their phones.
l6rmkl	100	20	NOK never recovered.
l6rmkl	101	37	The asshole they sent from Microsoft?
l6rmkl	102	82	Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did.
l6rmkl	103	25	His name is Stephen Elop.
l6rmkl	104	11	Look it up.
l6rmkl	105	76	So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes.
l6rmkl	106	25	But what don't they have?
l6rmkl	107	6	Money.
l6rmkl	108	121	That's why they're building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.
l6rmkl	109	73	But if we drive the share price up, do you think that's going to change?.
l6rmkl	110	11	So FUCK IT.
l6rmkl	111	41	I'm in for every penny, and I am HOLDING.
l6rmkl	112	131	I'll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I'll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.
l6rmkl	113	41	TL DR NOK is literally going to the moon.
l6rmkl	114	19	Go there with them.
l6rmkl	115	78	Edit I've got a lot of messages, here are my answers to the most common ones .
l6rmkl	116	23	Remember, I'm an idiot.
l6rmkl	117	18	I don't know shit.
l6rmkl	118	51	I see cheap NOK, I like cheap NOK, I buy cheap NOK.
l6rmkl	119	34	I'm not a stockbroker or anything.
l6rmkl	120	100	All I know is it's a healthy, undervalued company with massive upside potential, new space tech etc.
l6rmkl	121	67	There is downside risk, but the risk is smaller than the potential.
l6rmkl	122	140	So if you invest 5k, you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days.
l6rmkl	123	88	Would I bet a dollar to win 100, if yesterday everyone who bet added 50% to their money?
l6rmkl	124	5	Yeah.
l6rmkl	125	49	Might lose a quarter, but could gain 100 dollars.
l6rmkl	126	42	Do I know it's definitely going to happen?
l6rmkl	127	14	Of course not.
l6rmkl	128	74	What happened yesterday, 1bn NOK shares traded, HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
l6rmkl	129	33	IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.
l6rmkl	130	19	Edit for the lols .
l6rmkl	131	17	SAUCE ON THE 1TB.
l6rmkl	132	20	3310 STILL CHARGED .
l6rmkl	133	15	UNBREAKABLE NOK
l6rj8q	0	22	Tell Melvin who we are
l6r0w0	0	35	NOK IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY.
l6r0w0	1	141	To all the new users browsing this sub, I know NOK may look like the easy investment out of all the meme stocks being talked about right now.
l6r0w0	2	88	After all, it's only $6 while GME is $300 , so it might moon just like GME did right!?!.
l6r0w0	3	6	WRONG.
l6r0w0	4	43	There's more to stocks than just its price.
l6r0w0	5	67	Let me teach you something about outstanding shares and market cap.
l6r0w0	6	38	Market cap total shares x stock price.
l6r0w0	7	73	Right now the market cap of NOK is 37 billion while GME is 24.24 billion.
l6r0w0	8	53	This makes NOK have GREATER value than GME, NOT less.
l6r0w0	9	40	In other words, GME IS CHEAPER THAN NOK.
l6r0w0	10	132	For NOK to jump to $100 a share, that would mean it's market cap increases by a bit more than 15 times, making it worth 555 BILLION.
l6r0w0	11	74	If it matches GME's $300 price, that would make it worth over $1 TRILLION.
l6r0w0	12	101	To put things into perspective, if GME was worth $1 trillion, its stock price would be over $13,000!.
l6r0w0	13	69	The main takeaway is STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PRICE OF THE STOCK.
l6r0w0	14	25	IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
l6r0w0	15	84	The more outstanding shares there are also means the harder it is to move the stock.
l6r0w0	16	89	There's WAY more NOK shares out there than GME, so good luck getting that to go anywhere.
l6r0w0	17	65	Finally, GME is the only stock being shorted as heavily as it is.
l6r0w0	18	86	If you don't know what this means, just know that it means it has more moon potential.
l6r0w0	19	27	tl dr NOK is a distraction.
l6r0w0	20	23	It's not going to $100.
l6r0w0	21	39	There's more to a stock than its price.
l6r0w0	22	77	"Learn something called \"market cap\" and \"shares outstanding.\" Load up on GME."
l6r0w0	23	20	See you at $10,000 .
l6r0w0	24	190	EDIT Buying NOK cause it's cheap and you think it'll get you more gains than GME is like bringing a bus to the Daytona 500 and thinking you'll finish first cause you have the biggest engine.
l6r0w0	25	88	EDIT 2 I'm not bringing up valuations cause I think valuations mean shit in this market.
l6r0w0	26	11	They don't.
l6r0w0	27	43	Anyone with half a brain cell can see that.
l6r0w0	28	156	"I'm bringing it up to SHOW people the relative value of NOK compared to GME so that they don't think \"oh it's so high already, it's not gonna go any higher."
l6r0w0	29	32	"NOK is low though so it must!!\"."
l6r0w0	30	119	This is not even to mention the fact that the more overvalued you are, the harder it is to increase your overall value.
l6r0w0	31	104	It's easy to go 10x from a market cap of 1B, but it gets harder to go from 10B to 100B, 100B to 1T, etc.
l6r0w0	32	169	The fact that I even have to add this cause you guys are missing my point just shows that the hedge funds are winning in manipulating you guys to spread us out from GME.
l6r0w0	33	67	"EDIT 3 changed \"overvalued\" to \"greater value\" cause technical term"
l6pb04	0	210	The anatomy of a blatant market manipulation to cause FUD via methods that cause the absolute maximum of carnage and psychological shock or, the latest shady AF trick to come out of the investing inner circle .
l6pb04	1	87	Cliff's Notes You're going to be fine as long as you recognize their smoke and mirrors.
l6pb04	2	57	This is going to be something of a high level discussion.
l6pb04	3	58	I highly encourage everybody to go and dig up the charts .
l6pb04	4	230	particularly the AH charts from 6 30 PM EST until the time that WSB came back from privacy lock to audit and verify the veracity of what I'm saying because I'm too damned lazy to screen grab them and upload them and link them etc.
l6pb04	5	6	Lads,.
l6pb04	6	194	What you saw tonight was nothing short of the most coordinated disinformation and psy op strike ever conducted by the insiders of Wall Street, perpetuated upon the retail traders of Main Street.
l6pb04	7	150	It drew heavily upon Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, the agility of John Boyd, the robber barony of Rockefeller, and the deviousness of Tywin Lannister.
l6pb04	8	38	Let's examine the course of this day .
l6pb04	9	18	First, the PsyOps.
l6pb04	10	73	First, they sought to control the narrative using figureheads the media .
l6pb04	11	248	Everything from taking Andrew Left's accusations of threats against his children at face value to claiming that a bunch of day traders somehow hacked a hedge fund, they were on full blast all day on TV and in print about how retail was the villain.
l6pb04	12	33	Then, they spread misinformation.
l6pb04	13	151	"The headline on Marketwatch this morning was something along the lines of \"Reddit already plotting its endgame to take the money and run\" or something."
l6pb04	14	28	It was like this everywhere.
l6pb04	15	401	"Then, they found \"experts\" willing to go on TV and shill these narratives to create FUD in anyone who wasn't on the rocket yet, or to create fear to inspire paper hands to sell by making wild accusations about how the SEC is going to suspend trading for 30 days or investigate people for collusion or how if this continues, there will be punishments doled out in the form of reduced access to markets."
l6pb04	16	35	CNBC was especially guilty of this.
l6pb04	17	210	"At some point they even suggested that if you bought one of these meme stocks, it was possible you were helping a \"foreign agent\" like Iran overthrow the government by exploiting a strip mall video game vendor."
l6pb04	18	329	Then, they attempted to turn potential allies into enemies by claiming that, because these hedge funds who were completely innocent for shorting 140% of a stock were being brought to their knees and forced to liquidate their long positions, that we were responsible for the larger drop in the market because we were shaking MM's.
l6pb04	19	232	Just to put an exclamation point on this, an obvious assault on market prices in the power hour, sending everything but the meme stocks sharply lower by creating liquidity vacuums was orchestrated that took the markets down like 3%.
l6pb04	20	40	Because of 1 company worth 2% of Amazon.
l6pb04	21	118	"To tie it all home, they timed their afternoon messages to coincide with devastating actions against the \"insurgents\"."
l6pb04	22	179	"What, you think it was pure coincidence that the \"breaking news\" that Discord had banned the Discord server occurred at the EXACT moment CNBC and Bloomberg were talking about WSB?"
l6pb04	23	47	If you believe that, I've got a bridge for you.
l6pb04	24	151	To tie a bow on that, they made a point to point out that, because the Discord server was a bit of a cesspool that it means everybody in WSB is a Nazi.
l6pb04	25	88	Because it's easier to stop allies from rallying to a cause if the enemy is dehumanized.
l6pb04	26	64	And, of course, all these actions happen AFTER the closing bell.
l6pb04	27	21	And then, the ambush.
l6pb04	28	46	But the most egregious and flat out evil move?
l6pb04	29	36	Happened at 5 pm, almost on the dot.
l6pb04	30	100	Suddenly, in AH trading inhabited almost exclusively by brokers, a VERY SPECIFIC group of equities .
l6pb04	31	29	GME, NOK, BB, AMC, and BBBY .
l6pb04	32	30	absolutely PLUMMETED in value.
l6pb04	33	78	Curiously, almost NO OTHER STOCK anywhere on the market had this kind of move.
l6pb04	34	18	JUST these stocks.
l6pb04	35	105	Quite a coincidence, eh ? Now it's easy to blame this on the privatization of WSB, sure, but look deeper.
l6pb04	36	85	Inside the numbers, and how they pulled off the biggest psychological attack of all .
l6pb04	37	43	The sub isn't why these equities collapsed.
l6pb04	38	127	The great thing about AH trading is the volume is so low that you can actually watch individual trades go through in real time.
l6pb04	39	47	Shares of these meme companies were being sold.
l6pb04	40	212	1 or 2 shares at a time, and they were being sold for a few cents less each time, until the Depth Chart ran into a quantity of shares, and then all of a sudden a slightly larger burst of buy orders would come in.
l6pb04	41	201	They walked these 5 stocks down a few cents at a time until they found gaps where there was absolutely no sell action, at which time a sell would be created at a lower number just above the next order.
l6pb04	42	28	What was actually going on .
l6pb04	43	179	Colluding firms were orchestrating this to hunt for stop loss orders and to systematically drive down the price when there was almost nobody around to buy dips or watch it happen.
l6pb04	44	197	"They were \"buying\" individual quantity shares from each other at progressively lower numbers in their hunt while everybody else was eating dinner or watching CNBC hearing about the Nazis of Reddit."
l6pb04	45	55	They positively COLLAPSED the price of these 5 stocks .
l6pb04	46	451	"the privatization of WSB which news media dutifully referred to as a \"suspension\" was done to create a sense of panic in anybody who held equity in one of these companies in the hopes that they would pull the cord and bail out because the epicenter of the movement had been destroyed after a long day of psychological manipulation to condition everybody to view that epicenter as bad and untrustworthy, and their life's savings had just been hammered."
l6pb04	47	28	All under cover of darkness.
l6pb04	48	69	And it was performed with an absolute bear minimum of actual stocks .
l6pb04	49	58	just a couple thousand total changing hands over and over.
l6pb04	50	56	Don't just take my word for it, go look at the movement.
l6pb04	51	100	You know a lot of people out there who just have to trade 2 shares of a 7 dollar stock after hours?.
l6pb04	52	13	Did it work?.
l6pb04	53	12	Hard to say.
l6pb04	54	96	What's not hard to say is that WSB coming back into public mode certainly plugged the maneuver .
l6pb04	55	105	one which would have taken these companies down by 80% had counter information had not been brought back.
l6pb04	56	175	But I'm sure a lot of people panic sold, and even more will log in tomorrow to see bright red losses and figure the game is over, so on some level it's clearly done something.
l6pb04	57	4	BUT.
l6pb04	58	223	you can actually look at a GME chart and see the exact moment this sub came back, because the march downwards immediately reversed and the equity recovered almost 50 dollars in share price to get back up near the $300 mark.
l6pb04	59	24	Are you going to be OK?.
l6pb04	60	133	Depends on if you have a strong stomach, and if those who also believe in the companies you believe in have a strong stomach as well.
l6pb04	61	62	I've been asked a couple of times tonight if these big firms .
l6pb04	62	192	which have transitioned from trying to use their money to bully everyone to outright OVERTLY rigging the game and cheating because they were losing under their own already unbalanced ruleset .
l6pb04	63	51	could continue to swing big dick to wreck everyone.
l6pb04	64	121	And the answer, at least with the heavily shorted of these meme stocks, is no a couple of these are not heavily shorted .
l6pb04	65	80	Everything they've done has been psychological manipulation and smoke screening.
l6pb04	66	68	They're still backed into a corner, just like they were 9 hours ago.
l6pb04	67	49	They're still facing absolutely monstrous losses.
l6pb04	68	52	Nothing they've done has gotten them away from that.
l6pb04	69	46	Everything they've done has been to your mind.
l6pb04	70	40	They haven't gained any ACTUAL strength.
l6pb04	71	95	They can't control volume because they can't create shares, at least not for more than one day.
l6pb04	72	158	"Which is why they resort to parading out an endless string of \"experts\" on tv casting retail as the villain and making the show hosts dance for their masters."
l6pb04	73	245	But as long as people don't fall for it, these moves will not only not work, but blow up in their face because the public sentiment is now so far against them that there's a risk of a full on revolt of the entire internet against big investment.
l6pb04	74	134	The internet has EXPLODED in outrage that has the makings of the same type of powder keg that ignited the Occupy Wall Street movement.
l6pb04	75	79	except this isn't one that you can just turn your head and walk past or ignore.
l6pb04	76	133	"The story has morphed from \"retail investors find someone with their hand in the cookie jar, those scamps\" to one of \"class warfare\"."
l6pb04	77	67	You can't control the internet, and they just attempted to do that.
l6pb04	78	46	When you fail, it makes things 10 times worse.
l6pb04	79	147	But they're going to keep pulling shit like this to try and get people to sell in a panic, because it's literally the only card left in their deck.
l6omgp	0	68	"NY Times on our GME run \"Propelled by a mix of greed and boredom. \"."
l6omgp	1	202	Imagine co writing the New York Times biggest piece on class warfare in a decade and completely missing the fact that poor and middle class investors are doing this out of a sense of survival and spite.
l6omgp	2	162	Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession.
l6omgp	3	326	You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action literate, engaged, working poor to middle class and the action itself is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?
l6omgp	4	312	There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough.
l6omgp	5	145	This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system.
l6omgp	6	10	We're not.
l6omgp	7	9	We can't.
l6omgp	8	34	These motherfuckers can, and have.
l6omgp	9	43	We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.
l6omgp	10	109	"Make up whatever story gets you the headline, \" above the fold as you so deliciously revel in bragging about."
l6omgp	11	32	I hope you both learn from this.
l6omgp	12	290	"Because you didn't even bother to spend any time here listening to what these working folks have been shouting into every post on the board, shouting on Twitter, on Facebook, into our phones as we watch the stock green dick rocket every hour on Robinhood \"THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY!\"."

l6oeoq	0	24	Where is the loss porn?.
l6oeoq	1	37	Maybe I'm the only one who's noticed.
l6oeoq	2	36	But this sub has gotten a lot worse.
l6oeoq	3	43	All I see now is tendies and diamond hands.
l6oeoq	4	79	This used to be one of those awesome subs where you'd get next level loss porn.
l6oeoq	5	148	You'd get something like u 1R0NYMAN posts every week, and then you wouldn't know if they got shot in the back alley by a credit card company hitman.
l6oeoq	6	27	Then the GUH video dropped.
l6oeoq	7	38	That was some hardcore amateur stuff!.
l6oeoq	8	44	But lately the quality has really gone down.
l6oeoq	9	59	I could get better loss porn on like mainstream news sites.
l6oeoq	10	95	Like there was this one company that lost something like $2.6B but you know that stuff is fake.
l6oeoq	11	37	No Robinhood bans and they get loans.
l6oeoq	12	47	There's no meat, no long lasting repercussions.
l6oeoq	13	71	Real bankruptcy never happens with any of these big hedge fund studios.
l6oeoq	14	153	I dunno, if any of you old timers are into that kind of underground stuff too can you link me to some other good subs with some amateur loss porn $200k ?
l6nani	0	62	I'm Sick of Hearing Wall Street Act Like We Can't Handle Risk.
l6nani	1	105	On CNBC, the hosts and the interviewees kept circling back to how retail investors are in over our heads.
l6nani	2	96	As if we're all so dumb that we don't realize these stocks can go down just like they can go up.
l6nani	3	55	Motherfu er, have you even been through this subreddit?
l6nani	4	35	We know exactly what the risks are.
l6nani	5	123	This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.
l6nani	6	32	We get it more than you do CNBC.
l6nani	7	22	We know there is risk.
l6nani	8	59	Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.
l6nani	9	16	That's bullshit.
l6nani	10	125	None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.
l6nani	11	36	What exactly are we risking anyways?
l6nani	12	65	Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.
l6nani	13	51	We are the exact people who should be taking risks.
l6nani	14	91	$10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.
l6nani	15	154	These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.
l6nani	16	92	This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.
l6nani	17	153	Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.
l6nani	18	87	The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.
l6nani	19	35	The downside is usually overstated.
l6nani	20	82	So yeah, fuck off CNBC analysts and stop telling us you're worried we'll get hurt.
l6nani	21	27	That's not your real worry.
l6nani	22	66	Your worry is that we're exposing how rigged the system really is.
l6m429	0	26	$NIO Old flames never die.
l6m429	1	43	Ok, so gather around, a proper DD incoming.
l6m429	2	63	Nio is one of the stonks that most joys have brought me in WSB.
l6m429	3	163	Now backed by several big banks and some might consider it more institutional, but I still think it has the opportunity to have a huge upside like in the ol' days.
l6m429	4	16	In other words .
l6m429	5	37	"\"Where there was fire, ashes remain\"."
l6m429	6	20	Why do I think that?
l6m429	7	26	Because of the following .
l6m429	8	113	1. Earnings will be astronomical for the stonk as deliveries of vehicles have been spectacular 111% increase YOY.
l6m429	9	97	2. The company is always innovating as seen on demo day with the program related to self driving.
l6m429	10	269	3. The company knows what its doing they offer shares to raise more capital and reinvest it to grow the company they plan to open a new factory in Denmark to start covering Europe, charging stations are becoming extremely popular, and they are making a shitton of them.
l6m429	11	288	4. And finally they are in China if don't know about this country because you missed geography in school is the most populated country on earth and a major economic player in the world, so if the company reaches 2% of the population and sells to this 2% each year, guess how much that is?
l6m429	12	75	Let's do the math together to avoid mistakes 1,393,000,000 0.02 27,860,000.
l6m429	13	88	The point I'm trying to get across is that there is a lot of market to cover and expand.
l6m429	14	57	That's a lot of cars, and this is only considering china.
l6m429	15	403	If they start production and sell to other countries, we are looking at an incredible amount of sales, and sales lead to revenue, revenue leads to a company having a huge upside as it's a possible catalyst, and that leads you to have a stonk with a huge price increase, kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house and live in the most special place in the world Tendie town , those sweet sweet tendies!.
l6m429	16	31	Positions 200 NIO shares 58.36.
l6m429	17	21	What's my background?
l6m429	18	245	Well, I did a WSB fund with stonks in python using a max Sharpe ratio, that got banned because a certain stock at that moment was a low cap, but if you followed that portfolio you would have outperformed the S&P this year by 1000% approximately.
l6m429	19	180	I also published a post on PLTR when nobody gave a flying fuck about the stock and was trading at 23 USD with shitron shorting it and everybody saying it was completely overpriced.
l6m429	20	47	You would be up by 66% if bag hold 'till today.
l6m429	21	39	TLDR So buckle up, $NIO will fly again.
l6m429	22	57	By simple math and good management, this is meant to fly.
l6l2mr	0	52	"William Gavin on WSB \"the retailers are vulnerable\"."
l6l2mr	1	46	I felt like I needed to get this off my chest.
l6l2mr	2	37	I've lurked this sub for over a year.
l6l2mr	3	74	Throughout the pandemic, this subreddit and the discord have been my home.
l6l2mr	4	84	I turned $800 into $20k, not the most money, but the most fun I've had in some time.
l6l2mr	5	28	You guys have made me laugh.
l6l2mr	6	49	You guys have made me cry with bad options plays.
l6l2mr	7	45	You guys have made a lonely time less lonely.
l6l2mr	8	82	I've never been more excited to see others make money while I watched on the side.
l6l2mr	9	51	Today, like us all, I've been reading through news.
l6l2mr	10	219	"William Gavin, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told Barron's we should halt Gamestop for a month to let it cool down because \"small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.\"."
l6l2mr	11	73	The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us.
l6l2mr	12	26	He said we are vulnerable.
l6l2mr	13	61	"He said we are too \"unsophisticated\" to understand our risks."
l6l2mr	14	47	He said that shorts at least are sophisticated.
l6l2mr	15	28	Its so stupid its laughable.
l6l2mr	16	45	As if we are simply children mashing buttons.
l6l2mr	17	28	We are adults, with crayons.
l6l2mr	18	55	So Bill, please tell us how vulnerable we are tomorrow.
l6l2mr	19	94	"\"I think the little guys you describe are probably the ones most likely to get hurt,\" he said."
l6l2mr	20	107	"\"Those that are more sophisticated who might be shorting they may get hurt, but they're more sophisticated."
l6l2mr	21	49	They probably understand the risk they're taking.
l6l2mr	22	24	EDIT Please dont upvote.
l6l2mr	23	20	Just hit 6.9k Karma.
l6l2mr	24	35	EDIT 2 Too late, karma to the moon.
l6kgik	0	65	Explanation for noobs who don't quite understand what's going on.
l6kgik	1	23	Mods does DD tag apply?
l6kgik	2	17	If not change it.
l6kgik	3	64	I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply .
l6kgik	4	39	So they're betting against the company?
l6kgik	5	33	Like, they have no faith in them?
l6kgik	6	44	Investing like this makes one feel horrible.
l6kgik	7	5	Yeah.
l6kgik	8	35	There are three ways you can short.
l6kgik	9	159	1 You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.
l6kgik	10	135	"If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry \"put\" right to sell at price option."
l6kgik	11	34	This might cost you 50c per share.
l6kgik	12	109	IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share.
l6kgik	13	98	You can also change your mind and sell the option either more profit or less loss than 50c share .
l6kgik	14	81	IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share.
l6kgik	15	93	If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option 50c share .
l6kgik	16	22	2 You're a big player.
l6kgik	17	164	"You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say \"Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?\" A set timeframe may be set."
l6kgik	18	36	I don't know for sure, but probably.
l6kgik	19	129	"Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says \"ok\" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them."
l6kgik	20	46	So you borrow them, and immediately sell them.
l6kgik	21	62	You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait.
l6kgik	22	96	When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them.
l6kgik	23	75	You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.
l6kgik	24	16	If you're wrong.
l6kgik	25	62	You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42.
l6kgik	26	74	So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back.
l6kgik	27	85	3 You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell.
l6kgik	28	35	This is great because it's cheaper!
l6kgik	29	21	No interest payments!
l6kgik	30	204	Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated.
l6kgik	31	95	Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes.
l6kgik	32	58	What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and
l6kgik	33	114	3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino.
l6kgik	34	64	You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.
l6kgik	35	225	So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're obliged to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more.
l6kgik	36	30	Now you're in a short squeeze.
l6kgik	37	70	You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do.
l6kgik	38	144	It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else.
l6kgik	39	25	So the price goes higher.
l6kgik	40	37	Your losses are potentially infinite.
l6kgik	41	87	What's slightly different between this particular short squeeze and all the others is .
l6kgik	42	77	1 The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed.
l6kgik	43	57	They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible.
l6kgik	44	190	The only way out of that self made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step.
l6kgik	45	49	Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered
l6kgik	46	59	"6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say \"Hey!"
l6kgik	47	128	"how much would you sell those 4 cars for?\" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I \"finish\" my \"10 car delivery."
l6kgik	48	158	2 Retail traders are acting as one single semi coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund.
l6kgik	49	62	They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds HFs NEED to buy .
l6kgik	50	24	but they're not selling.
l6kgik	51	107	They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket.
l6kgik	52	71	Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it.
l6kgik	53	30	2a HFs can be negotiated with.
l6kgik	54	140	If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you.
l6kgik	55	275	If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank broker some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day.
l6kgik	56	38	"\"You quit this, and we'll owe you one."
l6kgik	57	43	"\" It's always good to have favours to call."
l6kgik	58	63	2b The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with.
l6kgik	59	24	They don't need favours.
l6kgik	60	64	They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage.
l6kgik	61	41	They don't give a fuck about any of them.
l6kgik	62	64	For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max .
l6kgik	63	138	and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two.
l6kgik	64	64	How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you?
l6kgik	65	10	You can't.
l6kgik	66	5	Edit.
l6kgik	67	31	Thanks for all the awards guys!
l6kgik	68	79	I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your etard Prince for the day!
l6kgik	69	57	I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am.
l6kgik	70	107	I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.
l6kgik	71	155	I'd like to thank the academy, and my parents who never believed in me, and Scruffy, my first dog, who, like WSB, played chicken with truck, and, and, and.
l6kgik	72	5	Also.
l6kgik	73	118	I figure since this is so popular, I might as well nominate my suggestion for the inevitable u deepfuckingvalue movie.
l6kgik	74	69	It's fairly likely to be seen as a sequel to the Wolf of Wall St, so.
l6kgik	75	44	"\"The Fox Foxes of Main Street\" ? Yeah, nah?."
l6kgik	76	13	Edit 2 NOTE .
l6kgik	77	90	To all the people trying to PM me for advice I have no fucking idea what WILL happen next.
l6kgik	78	83	I just think I cobbled together enough of what HAS happened to explain it somewhat.
l6kgik	79	30	Ie I'm more like a journalist.
l6kgik	80	44	Would you ask a journalist for stock advice?
l6kgik	81	24	please don't answer yes.
l6k3pi	0	54	None of these individuals are part of Wallstreet Bets.
l6k3pi	1	22	Nobody speaks for WSB.
l6k34p	0	42	WHY GME COULD GO ON TO BREAK ALL RECORDS .
l6k34p	1	15	Hold the line .
l6k34p	2	106	1. Everyday they try to cover their shorts and no one sells stock, the stock price would literally double.
l6k34p	3	116	2. Everyday they can't cover means they're BLEEDING money due to expensive interest rates they paid to borrow stock.
l6k34p	4	66	3. They're getting some help which only means we get more tendies.
l6k34p	5	54	ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT SELL, BLEEDING THEM ALL OUT.
l6k34p	6	122	4. They have their tactics and dirty tricks to trap investors but as long as you know why that's happening you'll be fine.
l6k34p	7	93	Also know the next day they will try to cover again leading to a further rise in stock price.
l6k34p	8	92	After hours is what they can control so seeing a 10 20% decline after hours don't mean shit.
l6k34p	9	77	5. Literally HOLDING THE LINE and delaying gratification would pay off BIGLY.
l6k34p	10	37	AND I MEAN BIG MASSIVE GREEN TENDIES.
l6k34p	11	100	I BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF AUTISM AND RETARDATION WILL PREVAIL AND WE WILL CELEBRATE IN VALHALLA!.

l6j4r9	0	65	Where do we go from here and who is going to step up to help us?.
l6j4r9	1	100	We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep.
l6j4r9	2	122	We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators.
l6j4r9	3	217	We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.
l6j4r9	4	68	We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty.
l6j4r9	5	126	You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad.
l6j4r9	6	60	That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome.
l6j4r9	7	228	We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore.
l6j4r9	8	201	Discord did us dirty and I am not impressed with them destroying our community instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts.
l6j4r9	9	25	That is pretty unethical.
l6j4r9	10	57	To add to this, people are co opting our name on twitter.
l6j4r9	11	123	"I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with \"wsb\" and \"wallstreetbets\" in them are pretending to speak for us."
l6j4r9	12	184	They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are.
l6j4r9	13	86	There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never ever political.
l6j4r9	14	103	The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent free in the mind of a blown up short.
l6j4r9	15	73	That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general.
l6j4r9	16	174	We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond.
l6j4r9	17	100	We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse.
l6j4r9	18	85	We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.
l6j4r9	19	155	That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.
l6j4r9	20	95	aka wsbmod is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.
l6j4r9	21	141	We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.

l6zfu9	2	106	At first I would've been happy to close out at $1,000, and had conditional sell orders set up accordingly.
l6zfu9	3	157	But then some shady shit went down between Melvin, Citron and CNBC, as well as widespread outages across brokers, which left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
l6zfu9	4	92	So fuck it, it's personal, I don't think I want to sell at $1,000 anymore, lets up it to 2k.
l6zfu9	5	21	Sell orders adjusted.
l6zfu9	6	72	Then Citadel, Robinhood and their ilk decided to lock people out of GME.

l6zfao	0	75	Dear WSB, I sincerely apologize for my paper hands today due to RH fuckery.
l6zfao	1	113	However, I will be taking them to small claims court in my state, suing for damages of $6500 of unrealized gains.
l6zfao	2	92	RH ToS states they reserve the right to de list or halt trading for any reason they see fit.
l6zfao	3	60	However, Section 13 of FINRA's prohibited behaviour states .
l6zfao	4	139	"\"13. Using manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent methods to effect a transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, a security.\"."
l6zfao	5	137	"If RH is able to remove the \"buy\" option of a stock at any time, then consequently, they could also remove the \"sell\" option at any time."
l6zfao	6	177	This removed confidence that I would be able to sell my rightfully owned stock when I felt the time was right, and compelled me to sell before realizing maximum potential gains.
l6zfao	7	183	Therefore, I am suing RH in small claims for violations of FINRA regulations, as well as their relationship with Citadel for $6500 as just compensation for their manipulative tactics.
l6zfao	8	76	Godspeed to you all here that are still in on this roller coaster of a ride.
l6zfao	9	81	I will be rooting for you to be dining in Valhalla on chicken tendies very soon!.

l6zjru	2	4	Hey!
l6zjru	3	179	i jumped on the bandwagon few days ago and threw just a $25 on the pile just to screw with the hedge fund, i'm not planning on getting rich throught it or not even getting a dime.
l6zjru	4	42	i just want to add my part to the bonfire.
l6zjru	5	102	i wish more people would do this with the minimum they can sacrifice, that would make a bigger impact.
l6zjru	6	26	but that's not the point .
l6zjru	7	82	in order to throw in my 25 i had to open a trader's account in the app i'm using .
l6zjru	8	8	Revolut.
l6zjru	9	95	i wanted to throw some more into other stocks, but some of them are not even visible in my app.
l6zjru	10	81	for example i can't find Nokia stocks at all, i think there were some others too.
l6zjru	11	142	i know some apps blocked the trading of some stocks because of us lmao , but Nokia stocks weren't visible since i opened the trader's account.
l6zjru	12	28	any ideas what's that about?

l6zjn8	4	61	I thought Robinhood was started to democratize stock trading.
l6zjn8	5	20	Those were all lies.
l6zjn8	6	143	As soon as your friends that you got lunch with on the upper east side and played golf with weekly, started hurting, you abandoned us for them.
l6zjn8	7	21	We will never forget.
l6zjn8	8	20	You are one of them.
l6zjn8	9	67	A Melvin lapdog, a CNBC ally, we know who you really are Robinhood.
l6zjn8	10	95	You don't steal from the rich and give to the poor you steal from us, your users, and for what?

l6zjn8	19	48	You will feel the pain that you inflicted on us.
l6zjn8	20	19	This is my promise.

l6zjn8	22	60	This is no longer about money to us, its about what's right.

l6zjh6	0	64	Lets own wallstreetbets.com and make this movement unstoppable!.
l6zjh6	1	71	Everyone, I am new to the movement but love what has been created here!
l6zjh6	2	220	I co own a software development company ledgerleap.com and am officially offering to donate my team's time and skills to build out a site and web hosted forum on wallstreetbets.com in case the reddit shuts down WSB here.
l6zjh6	3	108	The domain is expensive on namecheap $96,030 so we created a gofundme to cover the cost of the purchase at .
l6zjh6	4	100	"We can use a hosted forum software to power the site and get online fast as a \"just in case\" backup."
l6zjh6	5	72	If reddit goes down, having this online ahead of time will be essential.
l6zjh6	6	138	I was thinking that all moderators here could be invited to moderate the forum on this potential site if they are open to having a backup.
l6zjh6	7	76	I think a first version could be online in 1 week after securing the domain.
l6zjh6	8	79	We created the gofundme and the rest I leave up to the community and the fates.
l6zjh6	9	95	If the campaign gets traction enough to make the purchase, we are happy to donate the buildout.
l6zjh6	10	210	If the campaign goes over budget, we will apply the extra budget towards building extra features, future hosting costs, and cloudflare which would be nice to have in case the hedge funds rudely DOS the server .
l6zjh6	11	142	Think of this, if even a quarter of the people in here funded $1 then WSB would have the budget to be self hosted and unstoppable for decades.
l6zjh6	12	67	We need the support of the community and admins here for this work!
l6zjgq	0	16	Nok is buyable .

l6zooi	0	17	Make A Statement.
l6zooi	1	147	For anyone who truly believes in the free market, the actions by RH and other brokers to limit buy orders on various tickers is absolutely asinine.
l6zooi	2	120	They are showing their true colors by backing institutional traders and abandoning what they were supposedly founded on.
l6zooi	3	189	For decades Wall Street has used dirty tactics to screw over retail, and the first time they get a real dose of their own medicine they cry and conduct overt and public market manipulation.
l6zooi	4	87	RH, other brokers, hedge funds and the media have clearly stated what you are here for.
l6zooi	5	116	not to be a free market participate, but to be a source of money for institutions to screw over as much as possible.
l6zooi	6	28	You exist for their benefit.
l6zooi	7	41	It's the way of the world as they see it.
l6zooi	8	29	No one should stand for this.

l6zokc	2	90	I don't see how GME can continue to rally when retail investors are being disenfranchised.
l6zokc	3	64	It might be worth it to take our ball and go home take profits .
l6zokc	4	75	"But consider that we can still \"win\" by simply repeating the same strategy."
l6zokc	5	280	If rallies like GME start to happen more and more frequently, hedge funds will be forced to lay off their shorts which would be good for the overall economy and trading apps would eventually give up with the censorship after it becomes apparent that they'll never keep up with us.
l6zokc	6	86	I suggest GME profits should be put into $SLV, in order to directly fuck up JP Morgan.
l6zokc	7	155	I'm a retard, but I've read some good DD about how JP is always shorting silver and has actually been fined by the government for exploiting it so heavily.

l7006g	3	44	You claim your platform's name is Robinhood.

l7006g	5	53	I can't even begin to discuss how disgusting this is.
l7006g	6	118	I understand you want to IPO and suck up to these hedge funds but you are obviously blatantly manipulating the market.
l7006g	7	78	I can't even begin to express how ridiculous this is, manipulating FREE trade.
l7006g	8	101	This brokerage was a joke to begin with but we used you because it was easy and had a cult following.
l7006g	9	79	I just want to say, here is a big fuck you for making me lose most of my money.

l6zzyg	3	38	I don't make bets or invest in stocks.
l6zzyg	4	51	I'm not riding GME to the moon with all you hero's.
l6zzyg	5	54	I'm just a guy watching this show with some questions.
l6zzyg	6	74	Mainly, what happens if no one can buy the now highly inflated GME stocks?
l6zzyg	7	126	Everyone is acting as though the Hedge Funds who have shorted GME have no other choice than to buy back GME stocks at $69,420.
l6zzyg	8	97	But there is definitely a finite limit to the amount of money they can access to purchase stocks.
l6zzyg	9	83	What is to prevent these Orgs from declaring bankruptcy and defaulting on the debt?
l6zzyg	10	182	And if that were to happen, why is the little guy not left holding the bag once again, having invested his life savings in an over inflated stock that no one is now required to buy?.
l6zzyg	11	156	I'm sure there are good answers to these concerns, and that I'm simply uneducated on the subject, but I'd love if someone could address these issues for me.

l6zzqi	2	8	Hey all.
l6zzqi	3	59	I couldn't say how proud I am of these last couple of days.
l6zzqi	4	73	It has absolutely made me so happy to see this revolution on Wall Street.
l6zzqi	5	168	With everything happening in Robinhood re GME, AMC, and more, including other trading apps, it occurred to me that it's probably time to bring a new platform to market.
l6zzqi	6	112	One that supports healthy news flow, has a social forum like this, with as little to no restriction as possible.
l6zzqi	7	94	One that reflects and truly supports the 'main street' traders instead of Wall Street traders.
l6zzqi	8	16	No blocked buys.
l6zzqi	9	40	No cancelling orders without permission.
l6zzqi	10	52	No working with and for hedge funds on the back end.
l6zzqi	11	61	I'm in the process of getting my team together to build this.
l6zzqi	12	33	Is this something you would want?
l6zzqi	13	93	I will keep tabs on this post and thread with updates and anything that we move forward with.
l6zzqi	14	99	Will most likely launch a kickstarter to help this thing get off the ground completely and swiftly.

l6zz75	1	5	Hold.
l6zz75	2	88	If more people want to buy a stock demand than sell it supply , then the price moves up.
l6zz75	3	131	Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.
l6zz75	4	84	Because platforms are limiting the ability to purchase, it's driving the price down.
l6zz75	5	63	Once they open the doors back up, the prices will still be low.
l6zz75	6	66	The appeal to purchase will be there, and you can expect a return.

l70a3v	0	55	HOW TO BUY $GME IF YOUR BROKER BLOCKS YOUR $GME ORDERS.
l70a3v	1	49	Your broker may have blocked your orders for GME.
l70a3v	2	10	Fuck them.
l70a3v	3	83	But there are ETFs and funds out there that also hold GME and will buy GME for you.
l70a3v	4	62	Now, RETL holds the most in GME out of other ETFs 16% Source .
l70a3v	5	40	This is called replication or synthetic.
l70a3v	6	63	It's what Wall Street does when they block you from buying GME.
l70a3v	7	152	If you can short, you can also short the other holdings SFIX in the ETF and use that money from shorting to buy more RETL and gain more exposure to GME.

l70a20	0	59	The Market Makers are pulling the Prisoner's Dilemma on us!
l70a20	1	34	Don't let them get away with that.
l70a20	2	100	TL DR for marble brains at the bottom so your wife's boyfriend can read it to you like he did to me.
l70a20	3	83	For anyone who isn't familiar with the dilemma you can read up more in depth here .
l70a20	4	81	But who am I kidding, we don't know how to read nor do we have the time to do so.
l70a20	5	67	But for the rather curios i'll try to break it down in a nutshell .
l70a20	6	215	Two Criminals got caught but the there is not enough evidence to prove their wrongdoing, so the suits try to pull a trick on them, by offering each of them a deal for a lowered sentence if they betray the other guy.
l70a20	7	116	Both of them are isolated so they can not speak to each other and each one is told the other one gets the same deal.
l70a20	8	112	To put more pressure on them they also do tell them, if the other one takes the deal first, theirs will be void.
l70a20	9	31	So the outcomes are as follow .
l70a20	10	74	If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison.
l70a20	11	95	If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison.
l70a20	12	95	If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free.
l70a20	13	101	If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison on the lesser charge .
l70a20	14	81	If you read this far, you might wonder how this relates to the current situation.
l70a20	15	199	Well, Robin Hood and a bunch of other Apps got on their knees to suck some cocks under the table in order to keep us away from our tendies by restricting buying but not selling of $GME, $BB and $AMC.
l70a20	16	40	"We are now the \"prisoners\" here and by ."
l70a20	17	28	we give them what they want.
l70a20	18	11	But if we .
l70a20	19	87	like our prophet DFV they got nothing on us and everything comes cracking down on them.

l708xk	0	158	My Personal Opinion, and I am not a financial advisor in any aspect, is that this is a concerted effort to force everyone to sell before puts expire tomorrow.

l708xk	2	73	Those that are constrained will move their money to platforms that can't.
l708xk	3	45	The hedge funds cannot win if you don't sell.
l708xk	4	231	This is the game they have been playing since forever and they couldn't beat us legally so now they forced, ironically the day before expiry, some platforms to ban the tickers knowing people will sell and they can cover their puts.

l70i1x	1	104	I'm not sure very many of you are going to see this but I just need someone to hear what I have to say .
l70i1x	2	38	THE WORLD IS FINALLY PAYING ATTENTION.
l70i1x	3	265	2008 was caused by some of the grossest malpractice by Wall Street firms I have ever seen, and I swear to god I was convinced that some sort of regulation was finally going to happen and the people responsible for the fuck up would finally see some sort of justice.
l70i1x	4	8	BUT NAH.
l70i1x	5	34	The world literally just moved on.
l70i1x	6	92	Sure the SEC banned CDOs and over shorting but as we all know, that did absolutely FUCK ALL.
l70i1x	7	264	Hell there was a whole movie made starring some of the biggest actors in Hollywood detailing EXACTLY how far up your ass these firms and banks rammed their dildos, but people decided it was too convoluted and too difficult to understand, so AGAIN, nothing changed.
l70i1x	8	110	There was no widespread call for reform, nor any realistic effort at all to make sure it never happened again.
l70i1x	9	42	BANKS TO THIS DAY ARE STILL TRADING CDOs .
l70i1x	10	35	Fuck was I cynical before all this.
l70i1x	11	101	I swore that people only cared for themselves and that if they were comfortable they were complacent.
l70i1x	12	45	But holy hell guys, this time it's different.
l70i1x	13	65	WE HAVE FINALLY PAVED A PATHWAY TOWARDS MAKING A TRUE DIFFERENCE.
l70i1x	14	103	Occupy Wall Street had our level of conviction, but not the knowledge to direct it anywhere meaningful.
l70i1x	15	22	But this is different.
l70i1x	16	28	I REPEAT, THIS IS DIFFERENT.
l70i1x	17	110	We have finally found a way to bleed those responsible right in their jugular, but this is only the beginning.
l70i1x	18	66	If we're to make an actual difference then we can't stop with GME.
l70i1x	19	161	We have to make sure somehow that when the dust clears and Melvin and Shitron are 6 feet under that we hold these types of organizations accountable from now on.
l70i1x	20	155	The world is watching us and we're for the first time in a position to lead by example, so please, for the fucking love of god , DON'T LET THIS BE THE END.
l70i1x	21	137	For your fellow retards and autists, even if you don't have the money to go in, please, I beg of you, never stop fighting the good fight.
l70i1x	22	145	Never stop telling whoever is willing to listen how hard Wall Street has fucked us and how, in this moment, we finally found a way to fight back.
l70i1x	23	53	I think I realize now that people weren't complacent.
l70i1x	24	19	they were hopeless.
l70i1x	25	249	It's incredibly difficult to fathom where to even begin fighting back when you're at risk of going hungry or not having a roof over your head, on top of the knowledge that whoever you're fighting could bankrupt you and not even think twice about it.
l70i1x	26	44	However, I REPEAT, this time it's different.
l70i1x	27	41	This time, we're an informed collective .
l70i1x	28	72	We're literally in the spotlight and the entire country is our audience.
l70i1x	29	94	It's time to give hope back to the millions of people that had Wall Street steal it from them.
l70i1x	30	23	It's OUR time to shine.
l70i1x	31	6	TLDR .
l70i1x	32	80	Wall Street's fucked us for too long, let's show them how long our schlongs are.
l70i1x	33	27	DeepFuckingValue is my God.
l70i1x	34	45	10 shares at $97 and I'M NOT FUCKIN SELLING .

l70v9c	3	297	I grew that money to $4000, and since she has since passed away recently lost the house and all my savings I lived off last year , the gains I've had this past week on that $4,000 was going to let me pay off the truck that my dog and I are living in, AND take him to the skin specialist next week.
l70v9c	4	33	Now, all of those gains are lost.
l70v9c	5	151	I literally gave up everything when my mom got sick, and now that people like me catch a break while a lot of us are applying for jobs, we get screwed.
l70v9c	6	46	I've just lost faith in absolutely everything.
l70v9c	7	63	I didn't want a second vacation home, a yacht, or my own plane.

l70zbb	0	37	Why are they calling you guys Nazis?.
l70zbb	1	121	I'm not a participant of this subreddit, but I know enough about reddit to know that all but a few subs are left leaning.
l70zbb	2	70	Many heavily lean left, and the really big subs unanimously lean left.
l70zbb	3	130	So why is the mainstream media calling you guys Nazis, alt right actors, and comparing you to the people who stormed the capitol?.
l70zbb	4	146	I'll tell you why, because it's something that has been happening to us moderate, right centrist conservatives for years now, at least since 2017.
l70zbb	5	127	You've done something that the main stream media and other powerful individuals don't like, something they actually don't like.
l70zbb	6	191	You've done something that goes against the narrative they'd like to create, that goes against the power structures they have put in place, and you did it using their own system against them.
l70zbb	7	59	So they resort to their tried and true tactic you're Nazis.
l70zbb	8	80	You're greedy, selfish fascists, alt right radicals, possibly terrorists, even!.
l70zbb	9	39	You know you're not alt right radicals.
l70zbb	10	59	Most of you probably hate even moderately right wing views.
l70zbb	11	81	We probably wouldn't get along in any other context, because I lean center right.
l70zbb	12	84	You know that these groups are straight up lying about you and your political views.
l70zbb	13	21	Welcome to our world.
l70zbb	14	40	It's been happening to us for years now.
l70zbb	15	120	Any time we protest I'm not talking about the capitol, but things like people going in their cars to protest lockdowns .
l70zbb	16	88	"not even outside, in their cars , it's \"alt right radicals,\" \"neo Nazi proud boys,\" etc."
l70zbb	17	91	When really, it's just ordinary people who don't like the status quo and want to change it.
l70zbb	18	41	That's what's happening to you right now.
l70zbb	19	26	You are living through it.
l70zbb	20	152	I have sympathy for you, because I know what it's like to feel like I'm being lumped in with violent radicals and racists when I'm none of those things.
l70zbb	21	26	You know you're not Nazis.
l70zbb	22	24	I know you're not Nazis.
l70zbb	23	27	They know you're not Nazis.
l70zbb	24	416	"But the masses who know nothing about Reddit's political tendencies, have never heard of r wallstreetbeets and don't even know why there's an r in front of it, and who are just now hearing about this in the context of articles telling them there are \"alt right connections\" and \"parallels to Nazis\" here don't know that, and they'll believe the lie because they've believed the same lie over and over and over again."
l70zbb	25	166	"The next time you read about an event \"organized by Nazis\" or a group \"with ties to the alt right,\" just think about this moment, and ask yourself, is that the truth?"
l70zbb	26	24	Or is it just narrative?
l70zbb	27	189	Dig deeper, and find out if it's really the alt right because yes, sometimes it really is , or is it ordinary people who are tired of the status quo finally trying to do something about it?

l715sa	1	42	Citadel just restricted all trades on GME.
l715sa	2	134	40% of all trades of GME were happening via Citadel Robinhood etc use them which just effectively froze a massive chunk of the supply.

l715mw	12	33	So what's the point of this post?
l715mw	13	77	Well I believe that we could potentially change the landscape of US politics.
l715mw	14	57	You see how scared the Hedge Fund guys and Robinhood are.
l715mw	15	81	You boys have brought everyone on either side of the political spectrum together.
l715mw	16	70	You boys have created unity, and it's important to keep this unity up.

l714er	1	105	GME is getting halted and the hedges are selling to each other between the halts to knock the price down.
l714er	2	61	The halts are repeated to bring it down and scare the retail.
l714er	3	110	On top of this, they blocked buying GME from multiple platforms so we can only sell, to manipulate it further.

l71eho	5	32	Where do we file complaints to?.
l71eho	6	36	What moves do we have left to make?.
l71eho	7	62	Most importantly, how do we stop the hedge funds from winning?
l71eho	8	79	I have zero answers but I'd be more than happy to organize our path to victory.
l71eho	9	17	We could do this!
l71e4c	0	39	A personal experience of short selling.
l71e4c	1	85	During the financial crisis and on the run up to the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008.
l71e4c	2	98	I noticed the degree to which the hedge funds can essentially make the market at the cost to many.
l71e4c	3	76	I used to work for a UK bank and on leaving in 2007, had some 17k in shares.
l71e4c	4	82	"I always took the view, as many others did, that the banks were \"too big to fail\"."
l71e4c	5	216	In a normal market that was likely true but without the uptick rule or it's equivalent, when a stock is on decline a short position is clearly going to be advantageous to those with capital they are prepared to lose.
l71e4c	6	96	I tried to arbitrage my shares as they declined and spread my money across the various UK banks.
l71e4c	7	94	It seemed peculiar that each day the share price would rise until 3pm GMT when the Dow opens .
l71e4c	8	117	Then all of the days gains would be eliminated and the day closing price would be lower than at the start of the day.
l71e4c	9	193	Then I watched the ticker for the various UK banks and could see a major short position was put on at 3pm every afternoon for days or weeks, by a major US Hedge Fund probably not the only one .
l71e4c	10	80	The short position was closed at 4.30pm GMT when all UK trading was due to stop.
l71e4c	11	125	Essentially the hedge funds who had gained from the Mortgage market collapse were now betting on the failure of the UK banks.
l71e4c	12	47	I guess they eventually won, given the results.
l71e4c	13	105	It's easy to kick a share when it's down, the more you kick it the less chance it ever has of getting up.
l71e4c	14	58	The rich get richer and the poor or uninformed do nothing.
l71e4c	15	77	So glad to finally see a real attempt to level the playing field, keep it up!

l71guq	3	52	Robinhood no longer allows me to search or view GME.
l71guq	4	171	The only thing I can conclude from this is that Robinhood does not care about me, nor does it have any interest in my financial wellbeing, but instead seeks to control me.

l71frf	1	728	If you've bought GME today or yesterday and are down loads and thinking of selling or already have then all jokes aside your being stupid, first off always do your research before investing your money, and if you have even spent 5 mins looking at the posts here you'll see countless people saying hold this dip won't last forever, you've seen one minute of red and gone fuck I've lost all my money and sold that's on you, the whole point is to hold to the shorts can't get out easy stop posting your losses it makes other weak minded people think about and potentially sell aswell, just hold and if your getting scared and worried just take the next available profit and leave the stock market because it clearly isn't for you .
l71frf	2	56	TL DR just hold it's literally been said 1000s of times.

l71qas	0	24	Here's what's happening.
l71qas	1	6	Relax.
l71qas	2	5	Hold.
l71qas	3	29	GME has dipped, temporarily .
l71qas	4	60	I've been watching the numbers via Schwab's realtime stream.
l71qas	5	47	Here's what I've seen over the past 45 minutes.
l71qas	6	67	GME fell about 25% in a 5 or so minute window, then trading halted.
l71qas	7	54	It was released, fell by the same amount, then halted.
l71qas	8	15	Repeat, halted.
l71qas	9	85	At each halt, I watched the volume continue to climb for a few seconds and then stop.
l71qas	10	52	Likely just orders being filled as the dust settles.
l71qas	11	66	But then, the volume ticked up by no more than 4 during the halts.
l71qas	12	23	These are the big bois.
l71qas	13	28	Then a halt occurred at 126.
l71qas	14	49	GME was released, quickly climbed to 132, halted.
l71qas	15	27	It did the same, up to 155.
l71qas	16	8	Now 196.
l71qas	17	131	This likely means that shorts who kept shorting on the way up over the past few days were successful in covering their $126 shorts.
l71qas	18	62	They did this to hedge against their original, massive losses.
l71qas	19	71	There have been some good posts about this that I can't find right now.
l71qas	20	43	Someone please link those if you have them.
l71qas	21	28	Anyway, good for the shorts.
l71qas	22	30	They managed to grab peanuts .
l71qas	23	137	These are likely also smaller shorts scrambling to cover at a fire sale, knowing this thing won't go any lower before tomorrow's blowout.
l71qas	24	30	Why am I telling you to relax?
l71qas	25	62	Recall that this whole thing started in the low double digits.
l71qas	26	110	There's still a massive amount of money they need to cover, and now more than ever, they're getting desperate.
l71qas	27	152	Part of this too was probably people jumping ship from Robinhood, selling their shares and calls only to pick them up on whatever platform they land on.
l71qas	28	63	This was very likely part of Citadel's coordinated RH maneuver.
l71qas	29	71	Brutal, as they basically sank RH's reputation to protect their losses.
l71qas	30	16	How do we react?
l71qas	31	7	Simple.
l71qas	32	80	If you intend on jumping ship from RH, do so next week but keep holding for now.
l71qas	33	29	It costs you nothing to hold.
l71qas	34	52	Anyway, trading's released and we're back up to 200.
l71qas	35	34	Relax, the plan is still in place.
l71qas	36	68	Go crack a cold one and enjoy the skyrocket for the rest of the day.
l71qas	37	14	We're winning.
l71qas	38	13	Stay focused.

l71na1	4	70	Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing.
l71na1	5	75	Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage.
l71na1	6	26	This can take up to weeks.
l71na1	7	46	Seems Robinhood will be holding the line here.

l71v88	0	76	Question from options noob about getting permissions in interactive brokers.
l71v88	1	103	To Trade options on interactive brokers they want you to say you have been trading options for 2 years.
l71v88	2	130	While I have traded stocks for 2 years I never traded options, but I studied a lot about it and feel confident now to get into it.
l71v88	3	243	Their policy basically means you are not supposed to ever be able to start trading options on their site without having traded 2 years on a different site which is absurd because if all sites did that nobody will be able to trade options ever.
l71v88	4	102	So I suspect they just do it to cover their asses legally and don't really care what I write in there.
l71v88	5	108	My question is how big of a risk you think it is to lie to Interactive Brokers about my options experience .
l71v88	6	81	What do you think is the worst case scenario that can happen as a result of that.
l71v88	7	32	Losing all money in the account?

l72c03	1	62	A few days ago even being at $207 was considered a pipe dream.
l72c03	2	138	Since then we've seen the lofty heights of $450 before crashing down to earth while the shorts by and sell to one another see low volume .
l72c03	3	103	Now the original thesis was that a price of $115 or higher would trigger the short squeeze this Friday.
l72c03	4	73	I haven't heard anything about this today amongst all the doom and gloom.
l72c03	5	46	Is this now disproven or does it still stand?.
l72c03	6	56	Perhaps somebody much smarter than me can chime in here.

l728xk	2	19	Listen, don't sell.
l728xk	3	14	it'll be okay.
l728xk	4	44	Firstly, since I hope you're still reading .
l728xk	5	70	Hot Stocks Level 2 $BB, $AMC, $BBBY, $GME, $PLTR & $NOK Jan 28, 2021 .
l728xk	6	9	YouTube .
l728xk	7	74	Live hype GME chat support, you don't have to update like the WSB GME sub.
l728xk	8	16	Amazing support.
l728xk	9	68	This has kept me going through thick and thin, and its on slow mode.
l728xk	10	17	It is so quality.
l728xk	11	43	Please join, you will not regret it at all.
l728xk	12	180	Shareholders get scared on the drop because we they aren't sure if everyone on WSB is selling and holding and have no way of contacting them and hearing their support in real time.
l728xk	13	103	Every dip, this chat has told me to hold I have never regretted holding since, and don't regret it now.
l728xk	14	48	Now onto more details about what just happened .
l728xk	15	53	You can tell by volume this is a short ladder attack.
l728xk	16	70	The bid ask spread is ridiculous this thing will rocket like no other.
l728xk	17	69	They just lost capital trying to get us to sell, but NOBODY has SOLD.
l728xk	18	101	Breathe and hold we have seen this thing run up 100 300 dollars in one day alone this is the endgame.
l728xk	19	35	Everyone in this sub has your back.
l728xk	20	37	Secondly, this is what they expected.
l728xk	21	317	In short, by not letting Robinhood users buy shares or options, they killed the momentum by not letting them buy shares and killed reversed the gamma squeeze occurs when calls are ITM, but since they wouldn't allow Robinhood users to buy any , they didn't need to sell as many and consequently hedge by buying shares.
l728xk	22	75	They are scum and this is illegal and I know one day they will get justice.
l728xk	23	65	But for now, we have to ride it out until this restriction lifts.
l728xk	24	61	There's something about being a part of this that is amazing.
l728xk	25	124	All buying on Robinhood is closed for GME, which was an attempt to kill momentum and halt the gamma squeezes in my opinion .
l728xk	26	9	But hold.
l728xk	27	45	History will be made here one way or another.
l728xk	28	27	Be on the right side of it.
l728xk	29	122	They can try whatever shit they want but they don't realize that everyone on this sub is an idiot and has nothing to lose.
l728xk	30	47	I will never sell, and I know you won't either.
l728xk	31	26	You're stronger than that.
l728xk	32	40	Edit Also, look at what's happening now.
l728xk	33	200	They gave it everything they got to manipulate this shit down to 122, and now with every halt the trend is reversing jumped to 155 to 196, and probably even higher next where it will get halted again.
l728xk	34	18	This will be okay.
l728xk	35	35	Put your phone down if you need to.
l728xk	36	29	Edit2 Stock price is 212 now.
l728xk	37	57	This is just my speculation, and is not financial advice.

l725xr	0	136	About moving to Fidelity a couple of facts if you want to reduce your risk of being trade blocked by your broker during volatile events.
l725xr	1	64	I was just able to execute a trade to buy some $GME on Fidelity.
l725xr	2	171	So I agree with some others that Fidelity is not on the team of institutional colluders who are blocking one side of the trades created by the excessive shorts volatility.
l725xr	3	92	How long does it take before I can start trading after opening a Fidelity brokerage account?
l725xr	4	182	If you open an account on Fidelity and ACH some cash in from your bank account or Coinbase or whatever, you should be able to start buying stocks immediately while your funds settle.
l725xr	5	65	It does take more time steps to get approved for options trading.
l725xr	6	55	What about the stocks I have in my Robber Hood account?
l725xr	7	198	If you have another account that holds stocks like GME on Robber Hood or another brokerage, you can transfer the entire contents of the account, stocks and all, without having to liquidate anything.
l725xr	8	96	You just follow Fidelity's asset transfer process, which comes up easily as a result on Google .
l725xr	9	128	You can choose to transfer an entire account's contents from another broker, including bonds, etc, with just a couple of clicks.
l725xr	10	61	It does take a couple of days for the stuff to transfer over.

l72485	3	70	They've made it so, if you use a compromised brokerage, you can't buy.
l72485	4	52	They've made it so only those with money can remain.
l72485	5	55	They've made a short attack to invoke circuit breakers.
l72485	6	32	This is going to happen all day.
l72485	7	79	You are going to see the stock price go up and down like a flat lining patient.

l72gno	9	87	You have the opportunity to pivot and become a real contender to Steam in online sales.
l72gno	10	78	You have relationships with all of the major studios and you have market data.
l72gno	11	52	As for your stores, make them places to hold events.

l7298s	0	59	Theory on why brokers are disallowing trading of GME et al.
l7298s	1	116	I saw a post where someone was posting Citadel owns RH and forced them to stop initiating trades of the meme stocks.
l7298s	2	161	as far as i know there is no factual basis to Citadel owning RH, it has not been part of any public fund raising rounds dating back to inception of the company .
l7298s	3	360	When i think about it further, it takes a HUGE deal much bigger than collapse of 1 or 2 hedge funds, or the loss of customers for a few brokers for the SEC to allow something as drastic as stopping trading in these shares as it essentially guarantees huge losses to people who get in the past day, without appropriate price discovery to the upside or downside.
l7298s	4	71	and arguably benefits counterparties on the otherside of these trades .
l7298s	5	26	Citadel is a market maker.
l7298s	6	72	meaning they take the other side of when you buy sell a stock or option.
l7298s	7	73	All of these positions are should be hedged for risk management purposes.
l7298s	8	203	It is possible they either couldnt hedge in time due to the rapid price movements late last week early this week OR made an active decision to be exposed on the short side i think former is more likely .
l7298s	9	119	If this is true, it would put citadel's exposure as much greater than Melvin or likely any other individual hedge fund.
l7298s	10	21	This is a HUGE deal .
l7298s	11	48	much bigger than the failure of Melvin Capital .
l7298s	12	89	because Citadel is responsible for 33 45% market making activity on equity option trades.
l7298s	13	79	If they failed, it would conceivably have a huge role in destabilizing markets.
l7298s	14	15	Just my theory.
l7298s	15	51	definitely a fascinating look at market mechanics .

l73pxl	0	44	Market manipulation what to do and pep talk.
l73pxl	1	120	This might be a long post, but there is a lot of information floating around that I think needs to be compiled into one.
l73pxl	2	10	About me .
l73pxl	3	89	I have been in this community since I started college a little over 2 years ago, 21 now .
l73pxl	4	237	I have seen this group go from losing money on every trade, making shitposts on literally thousands of dollars of loss, and forcing RobinHood to reassess their risk management THREE TIMES to creating an army to take on the establishment.
l73pxl	5	254	Although I don't like how large this subreddit has gotten, this volume is necessary to maintain what we've accomplished so far thank you to the mods for how they have handled this growth, you guys are the best and most organized team on this site by far.
l73pxl	6	26	This subreddit is my home.
l73pxl	7	131	I'm so proud to be included here even if my baby gains post from 2 years ago was removed and then the mod called me a retard lmao .
l73pxl	8	21	Market manipulation .
l73pxl	9	132	As many of us know, and some are beginning to find out, the big boys are participating in market manipulation who would've thought??
l73pxl	10	94	Melvin and Citadel have both attempted to crash GME by injecting billions in a number of ways.
l73pxl	11	257	These ways include, but are not limited to, in no specific order crashing the stock AH where the volume is low hoping for a lower open, buying stop loss data in an attempt to create a snowball effect of sell orders, buying out the media looking at you CNBC.
l73pxl	12	285	"along with others to say that the squeeze has happened, to say that we are the problem, to say that we are the gamblers, to say that we are the ones that need to be regulated, tricking boomers into buying puts, and now SHUTTING DOWN ALL BUY TRADE FOR GME ON THE \"FREE AND FAIR\" MARKET."
l73pxl	13	56	This is disgusting, even for me and I watch snuff film .
l73pxl	14	141	Melvin themselves received a 2.5 billion dollar loan to cover their losses, but instead of cover they decided to use that money to attack us.
l73pxl	15	28	This is a day by day attack.
l73pxl	16	17	Where to buy GME?
l73pxl	17	36	Get rid of RobinHood for fucks sake.
l73pxl	18	95	If the constant server issues, worthless customer service, not knowing about leap years twice??
l73pxl	19	18	really RobinHood??
l73pxl	20	121	, and lack of account security wasn't enough to make you get out, then maybe BLATANT STOCK MARKET MANIPULATION is enough.
l73pxl	21	58	"\"oH We dId tHaT tO pRoTeCt oUr cLiEnTs.\" SHUT THE FUCK UP."
l73pxl	22	22	JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP.
l73pxl	23	21	NO YOU FUCKING DIDNT.
l73pxl	24	84	I had RobinHood because no other broker allowed me to open option positions blindly.
l73pxl	25	46	No other broker allowed me to bet on margin at
l73pxl	26	66	18. No other broker allowed me to bet on stock without experience.
l73pxl	27	65	RobinHood doesn't give a fuck about you, me, or any of its users.
l73pxl	28	45	They care more about the people funding them.
l73pxl	29	113	RobinHood is not the only one doing this, but they are the most popular amongst the youth that are buying up GME.
l73pxl	30	82	Interactive Brokers and WeBull to my knowledge are others that stopped buy orders.
l73pxl	31	62	I have used Fidelity for over a year now and they are perfect.
l73pxl	32	82	Outages are rare, customer service is great ever talk to someone from the Midwest?
l73pxl	33	62	Because I did when I called , and they are in it for the user.
l73pxl	34	10	Best part?
l73pxl	35	48	They are the largest institutional owner of GME.
l73pxl	36	31	Need me to explain that to you?
l73pxl	37	32	They only profit if GME goes up.
l73pxl	38	48	They won't stop the buy orders from flooding in.
l73pxl	39	95	I doubt you can create an account and transfer your money over in one day, but do what you can.
l73pxl	40	56	Where to report RobinHood, Melvin Capital, Citadel, etc.
l73pxl	41	47	Contact the House Financial Services Committee.

l73pxl	44	51	Thank you to u alphazed for bringing this to light.
l73pxl	45	72	Contact your senators, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Representative AOC.

l73pxl	48	49	Her contact info you can find on her website Rep.

l73pxl	69	11	Did I sell?
l73pxl	70	16	HELL FUCKING NO.

l731k7	1	49	Nice June article that explains what is going on,
l731is	0	34	Cant see stock options on Revolut.
l731is	1	84	Hi, like you all im trying to buy more on GME but cant due to Robinhood being turds.
l731is	2	104	I made a Revolut account to buy more but I can only see cryptos and cannot see any stock options at all.
l731is	3	47	Anyone know what the issue is or how to fix it?
l731gg	0	55	I am so proud of each and every one of you for holding.
l731gg	1	23	Thoughts from a r tard.
l731gg	2	152	Before this gets deleted, as MANY have mentioned the situation we are finding ourselves is not unlike the massive squeeze that happened in 2008 with VW.
l731gg	3	110	Melvin, Citadel, Robinhood and more are trying to suppress our power and most importantly our fucking tendies.
l731gg	4	47	All of you holding are not letting that happen.
l731gg	5	20	THINGS TO CONSIDER .
l731gg	6	84	1. VOLUME As we've been seeing these dips take note of the volume and how low it is.
l731gg	7	139	Starting from 9 AM today it was only around 300k and just recently the massive swing back from $200 to $300 , it's not us paper handing it.
l731gg	8	118	2. BUYING RESTRICTIONS Kind of odd how for such low volume RH, Webull, etc are now deciding how we should manage risk.
l731gg	9	214	As others have mentioned RH has a keen interest in opening an IPO and Citadel not only purchases consumer information from them but Robinhood actually sells your option orders to Citadel who profits off the spread.
l731gg	10	215	Sidenote Take a look at the last few days when billion shares of $NOK were being moved around there were no issues yet somehow with the meteoric finish from Monday till now they can't seem to manage what's going on?
l731gg	11	28	We can SELL but can't BUY??.
l731gg	12	121	I'm actually an idiot so don't listen to me but I am sure the smart people in here can either confirm or tear this apart.
l731gg	13	11	TL DR HOLD.
l731gg	14	5	HOLD.
l731gg	15	5	HOLD.
l731gg	16	66	WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON AND THESE FUCKS ARE TRYING TO SUPPRESS US.

l736yz	4	65	THE PRICE ACTION IS STILL OVERWHELMINGLY IN AN UPWARD TRAJECTORY.
l736yz	5	167	All they have managed to do is flatten out the squeeze, however until every one of those shorts closes out their position, they still continue to be guaranteed buyers.

l736yz	16	6	EDIT .
l736yz	17	42	And let me make something perfectly clear.
l736yz	18	29	I am not a financial advisor.
l736yz	19	66	Here is what skin I have in the game for the sake of transparency.
l736yz	20	58	I am up on GME and down on AMC at essentially a breakeven.
l736yz	21	52	I could easily sell now and be completely unscathed.
l736yz	22	27	I'm not fucking doing that.
l736yz	23	16	Do you know why?
l736yz	24	120	Because my risk tolerance on the few thousand dollars I threw at this thing is literally higher than If I were in vegas.
l736yz	25	78	I would literally rather see all of that money disappear than pull it out now.
l736yz	26	65	I'm either sailing this ship into valhalla or going down with it.
l736yz	27	83	Do you know what the risk tolerance is for Melvin Capital, Citron, Citadel, etc is?
l736yz	28	14	Extremely low.
l736yz	29	385	Those fucking morons stand lose money for a bunch of billionaires and millionaires, lose their entire elevated status that they've enjoyed for years, lose their rights to trade with the privileges that they enjoy and yet with that very clear motivation that they should have sensible risk tolerance, they leveraged themselves 10 1 into a short borrowing a stock into 140% of the float.
l736yz	30	56	Those morons are on the low ground in this duel, not us.
l736yz	31	57	WE ARE NOT FUCKING SELLING AND THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO BUY.
l736yz	32	76	No amount of market manipulation, collusion, and corruption can change that.
l7363v	0	127	THEORY WE WERE F ING RIGHT about $GME and SEC had to put a cap on infinite losses Hedge funds did not necessarily get off easy.
l7363v	1	51	EDIT TLDR the SEC stopped global market's collapse.
l7363v	2	108	They forced liquidation of GME into the market, and made hedge funds cap their losses to avoid GME infinity.
l7363v	3	56	Now it's recovered, it's a level playing field between .
l7363v	4	5	and .
l7363v	5	47	Hold and be ready to buy when we're allowed to.

l7363v	7	14	near perfect .
l7363v	8	74	to all brokerages disallowing the purchase of select stocks GME included .
l7363v	9	127	Why would all brokerages come together, especially WeBull this morning after throwing shade at Robinhood, and stop GME trading?
l7363v	10	28	Simple, they were forced to.
l7363v	11	14	WE WERE RIGHT.
l7363v	12	85	The MOASS was about to happen, and it was about to crash the entire financial system.
l7363v	13	18	Congrats, r tards.
l7363v	14	21	GME only fell to 112.
l7363v	15	79	Remember when we were fighting to beat 115 this Friday due to expiring options?
l7363v	16	32	Hedge funds were not bailed out.
l7363v	17	43	They simply were forced to put a cap on it.
l7363v	18	22	Hence the price spike.
l7363v	19	45	Keep holding, now it's a level playing field.
l7363v	20	125	Once we're allowed to buy back in, this thing WILL spike, driven by pissed off retail traders and the recent discount of GME.

l73d9v	0	10	$FUBO DD .
l73d9v	1	57	Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.
l73d9v	2	15	From u heardme.
l73d9v	3	107	Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition.
l73d9v	4	68	It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains.
l73d9v	5	91	I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.
l73d9v	6	54	First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability.
l73d9v	7	82	It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet.
l73d9v	8	100	To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003.
l73d9v	9	91	Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly.
l73d9v	10	12	Q3 Results .
l73d9v	11	170	Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year over year on a pro forma basis, or 71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020.
l73d9v	12	149	This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User ARPU and growth of advertising sales .
l73d9v	13	67	Subscription revenue increased 64% year over year to $53.4 million.
l73d9v	14	66	Advertising revenue increased 153% year over year to $7.5 million.
l73d9v	15	83	Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year over year.
l73d9v	16	74	Average Revenue Per User ARPU per month was $67.70, up 14% year over year.
l73d9v	17	132	Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users paid and free trial in the quarter increased 83% year over year to 133.3 million hours.
l73d9v	18	115	Monthly active users MAUs watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year over year.
l73d9v	19	24	Q4 Preliminary Results .
l73d9v	20	97	Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94 $98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year over year.
l73d9v	21	35	Prior guidance was $80 $85 million.
l73d9v	22	105	Paid subscribers at year end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year over year.
l73d9v	23	47	Prior guidance was 500,000 510,000 subscribers.
l73d9v	24	76	It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning.
l73d9v	25	120	Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus.
l73d9v	26	85	This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal.
l73d9v	27	77	FUBO is estimated to announce earnings between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021.
l73d9v	28	129	Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically hit by short sellers Kerrisdale Rich Greendfield as their lock up period expired.
l73d9v	29	60	This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60.
l73d9v	30	102	The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet.
l73d9v	31	80	As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable.
l73d9v	32	79	At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later.
l73d9v	33	78	This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen .
l73d9v	34	79	Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.
l73d9v	35	113	Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit just like Netflix did .
l73d9v	36	57	More customers mean they can charge more for advertising.
l73d9v	37	20	More on this later .
l73d9v	38	99	Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory.
l73d9v	39	43	The bear thesis is weakening significantly.
l73d9v	40	19	Almost nonexistent.
l73d9v	41	20	Now, on to the NBA .
l73d9v	42	99	"\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake."
l73d9v	43	99	This investment round was increased in late 2017 early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions.
l73d9v	44	72	The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round.
l73d9v	45	130	Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox.
l73d9v	46	144	However, for FuboTV's formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world Sky Media from the UK.
l73d9v	47	75	The Comcast owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.
l73d9v	48	78	David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo.
l73d9v	49	82	The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor.
l73d9v	50	112	I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.
l73d9v	51	30	Why am I bringing up the NBA?.
l73d9v	52	76	check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement .
l73d9v	53	141	People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition.
l73d9v	54	75	People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing.
l73d9v	55	138	Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform.
l73d9v	56	167	The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues which is why I think they threw in DraftKings .
l73d9v	57	42	Now, lets look into two key acquisitions .
l73d9v	58	9	Vigtory .
l73d9v	59	118	Fubo acquired them and put their co founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech.
l73d9v	60	7	Balto .
l73d9v	61	44	This one is another thing bears are missing.
l73d9v	62	156	They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.
l73d9v	63	54	Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward.
l73d9v	64	46	It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts .
l73d9v	65	41	34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted.
l73d9v	66	81	This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now.
l73d9v	67	82	Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60.
l73d9v	68	51	Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon.
l73d9v	69	103	It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday.
l73d9v	70	50	It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.
l73d9v	71	90	Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming sports betting.
l73d9v	72	7	TL DR .
l73d9v	73	32	get in long, one way or another.
l73d9v	74	25	Commons, LEAPS, anything.
l73d9v	75	98	this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings expected late January to mid February .
l73d9v	76	155	We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.

l759yn	0	55	GME TRADING HALT NOT DUE TO ROBINHOOD, BUT CITADEL????.
l759yn	1	101	At this point, it sounds like almost all the retail brokers have halted buying of GME, AMC, and KOSS.
l759yn	2	101	Public, Stash, and Webull have said it is because their clearing broker, Apex Clearing told them too.
l759yn	3	70	Note Robinhood uses its own clearing broker now, Robinhood Securities.
l759yn	4	21	It left Apex in 2018.
l759yn	5	43	Some, like TD Ameritrade, do self clearing.
l759yn	6	112	Although TDA also uses a separate, affiliated clearing broker similar to Robinhood in addition to self clearing.
l759yn	7	50	The clearing brokers are not the end of the chain.
l759yn	8	111	They route orders to market makers who can internalize the order take the other side or send it to an exchange.
l759yn	9	19	It goes like this .
l759yn	10	100	Retail customer places order Retail Broker Clearing Broker Market Maker 1 Internalize or 2 Exchange.
l759yn	11	110	SEC Rule 606 requires all broker dealers to report the % they route they orders to and their routing policies.
l759yn	12	166	For example, for September 2020 nonS&P500 aka GME, among others orders, Robinhood routed between 38% and 65% of its various order types market, limit, etc to Citadel.
l759yn	13	85	TD Ameritrade and its affiliate clearing broker sends up to 40% of orders to CITADEL.
l759yn	14	97	It's well reported that Citadel and Point72 backed up Melvin Capital on their short GME position.
l759yn	15	115	Note Citadel is actually multiple companies, including the asset management company then the market making company.
l759yn	16	64	I'm not sure which company actually loaned money for the shorts.
l759yn	17	76	Wiki says the market maker is a subsidiary of the asset management company .
l759yn	18	171	So this is unconfirmed speculation at this point, but is it possible Citadel told all the clearing brokers routing to it to halt buying or it would withdraw it's business?
l759yn	19	113	If so, that seems like clear market manipulation, especially given its interest in the short positions of Melvin.
l759yn	20	29	Even so, why would it matter?
l759yn	21	118	Other market makers like Virtu Americas should be able to step in and take the order flow business that Citadel won't.
l759yn	22	7	right?.
l759yn	23	152	Can anybody with time on their hands pull the Rule 606 disclosure reports for all the retail and clearing brokers and make a map to see who is involved?
l759yn	24	67	Then see what hedge funds are related to the various market makers?
l759yn	25	25	Who are the other shorts?
l759yn	26	95	I've only seen Melvin and Citron, but they don't have the entire short position on GME do they?
l759yn	27	79	The coordinated shutdown of retail buyers today certainly seems like collusion.

l7klm7	4	149	Even worse, I sold at the worst possible time at $120 share cuz at the time I thought the bottle had popped and it was gonna go double digit by EOD .
l7klm7	5	70	Downvote me and call me a fucking retard all you want but I need help.

l7k3vy	0	32	Some key points to keep in mind.
l7k3vy	1	96	Robinhood didn't halt trading just because they hate you, they did it because Citadel made them.
l7k3vy	2	119	Robinhood can't actually place your order themselves, they need to go to a market maker to find a counterparty for you.
l7k3vy	3	87	Citadel actually pays robinhood for this, because your trades are free money for them .
l7k3vy	4	128	they overcharge you on the spread, and they place their own trades immediately before yours to take advantage of price movement.
l7k3vy	5	152	They're the ones who want you to lose money they bailed out the biggest hedge fund shorting Gamestop, Melvin, so now they own a huge chunk of that fund.
l7k3vy	6	169	So now that they want the shorts to win, and the retail traders you to lose, they told robinhood to get lost, they just wouldn't be accepting buy orders on these stocks.
l7k3vy	7	11	Just sells.
l7k3vy	8	31	This has never happened before.
l7k3vy	9	77	Only then did Robinhood turn around and stab its retail traders in the back .
l7k3vy	10	46	because, of course, you're not their customer.
l7k3vy	11	26	Citadel is their customer.

l7k3vy	13	117	Ok, this one's new to me robinhood is apparently selling shares belonging to accounts that are not trading on margin.
l7k3vy	14	24	Margin calls are normal.
l7k3vy	15	89	Selling shares that your clients own outright is crazytown what in the world shenanigans.
l7k3vy	16	108	Your broker is lending your shares out to people who want them, like the hedge funds you're betting against.
l7k3vy	17	169	depending who your broker is you can call them and tell them to stop, turn off margin trading, set limit sells at stratospherically high prices, or go get a real broker.
l7k3vy	18	93	Your broker is selling your information, like your sell price, to anybody who can pay for it.
l7k3vy	19	267	if you set a stop loss sell at 100, and some other gambler set a stop loss sell at 115, then a hedge fund wanting to drive the price down can start to chain trigger stop loss sells until the prices reaches a level low enough to allow them to escape the short squeeze.

l784a6	1	87	Seems like last week when we were spreading that graphic around was a little too early.

l7j9q6	0	75	The Next Black Swan REEEEEEEtail Crushes Funds and Causes a Market Selloff.
l7j9q6	1	26	I will present some facts.
l7j9q6	2	92	These facts are all kind of similar, and arguably all say the same thing in different words.
l7j9q6	3	82	This is a good thing, because your smooth ass brain needs all the help it can get.
l7j9q6	4	72	You should read all of this, unless you can't read, in which case just .
l7j9q6	5	12	ALL IN GME .
l7j9q6	6	75	After, I will present the logical conclusion, and what you can do about it.
l7j9q6	7	75	Fact 1 Hedge funds are getting REEEEEEEEEEamed by the rotation into memes .
l7j9q6	8	5	See .
l7j9q6	9	1880	Lots of big funds are 'long short' they'll look at all of the stocks in a sector, like say retail or real estate, and rank them from best to worst. They'll go long the best one, and go short the worst one. You can probably already see where this is going the 'worst ones' have gotten way too shorted and way too beaten up, and now they're being squeezed. . . Oh, and the 'best stocks' haven't done much since August. That means the gains don't come close to cancelling out the losses. And god help the funds who are short only they are getting absolutely ass blasted, and you know they're not enjoying it cause if they did they'd be hanging out here posting fat loss porn with us.. . Fact 2 Shorts getting destroyed causes deleveraging and selling elsewhere in the market . . See and . . If there's one thing we know here at WSB, it's that you're a toilet paper handed bitch if you're not levered to the tits at all times. The biggest funds know this too, and being the biggest funds, they have access to way more leverage than you and I do. This is a bit of a problem for shorts though shorts need liquid capital to close their positions. If you've ever been in a situation where you sold a covered call or spread and got money for it and then immediately used that money to buy another call or something, but then you wanted to buy your spread or your covered call back, but couldn't close it because you just spent the money on something else. now you know what is going on at these hedge funds. They collected a bunch of money a long time ago when they shorted the stonk, and then immediately spent all that money to juice their returns, and now they need to have a fire sale just to have enough liquid capital to buy back their shit at a massive premium.. . If you imagine the case of your typical long short fund, that means they're being forced to sell their 'best' stocks.
l7j9q6	10	137	If you imagine a short fund, that means they're asking for bailouts and you're probably gonna find some of them behind Wendy's next week.
l7j9q6	11	92	Fact 3 The extreme volatility and volume in some stocks is causing a minor liquidity crisis.
l7j9q6	12	5	see .
l7j9q6	13	80	Let's say you're broke but want to YOLO on GME, so you need to raise some money.
l7j9q6	14	204	You go to a pawn shop and pawn them your graphics card for $1000, because they know they can go sell that fancy RTX3090 super duper titanium RGB hentai edition for more than $1000 on ebay if they need to.
l7j9q6	15	184	Well, the next day, imagine people start speculating on graphics cards, and the prices go crazy some start selling for 10$ and some start selling for $5,000 and every price in between.
l7j9q6	16	178	"If you try to pawn that graphics card tomorrow, the pawn shop is gonna look at it and say \"hell no, we have no idea how much we can sell that for, we're not gonna take that risk."
l7j9q6	17	66	This is basically what's happening with loads of stocks right now.
l7j9q6	18	158	Ordinarily it's not a big deal everyone knows how much a stock is worth right now, and it's extremely extremely likely it will be worth about the same price .
l7j9q6	19	80	a few percent with 99% probability tomorrow and the day after and the day after.
l7j9q6	20	42	So they're happy to take it as collateral.
l7j9q6	21	72	But right now, some stocks are going up and down by 100% within minutes.
l7j9q6	22	93	A stock could literally go from hundreds of dollars to next to worthless within a day or two.
l7j9q6	23	43	So nobody is gonna take that as collateral.
l7j9q6	24	69	If you own that, for all intents and purposes, you have zero dollars.
l7j9q6	25	127	If you want to use your positions as leverage, or if you were ALREADY using your positions as leverage, this is a huge problem.
l7j9q6	26	53	You need to find some different source of collateral.
l7j9q6	27	67	If you can't, you need to sell shit so that you have good 'ole USD.
l7j9q6	28	90	It's not just hedge funds that are feeling squeezed it's the clearing firms and banks and.
l7j9q6	29	64	basically anyone that uses stonks as collateral for any purpose.
l7j9q6	30	287	By the way, this is what caused most of the selling back in March last year folks needed to raise money RIGHT NOW, which meant selling all their shit RIGHT NOW, which meant stonks went down, which caused a cascade of margin calls and liquidations for folks that were levered to the tits.
l7j9q6	31	114	Fact 4 Indices are at all time highs, every sentiment indicator is at MAXIMUM EUPHORIA, but volatility is rising .
l7j9q6	32	22	See any fucking chart.
l7j9q6	33	92	"As one of the greatest autists of our time once said, \"be fearful when others are greedy.\" ."
l7j9q6	34	127	Everyone and their mother is levered to the tits why wouldn't you be, the fed is handing out free loans to anyone with a pulse!
l7j9q6	35	137	That's great cause it makes stonks go up really fast, but if stonks start going down, they're also gonna go down really fucking fast too.
l7j9q6	36	246	Any selling will get further amplified by option gamma, the same forces that are propelling Gamestop in every direction simultaneously, and the same forces that propelled the markets upwards particularly the big tech stonks after the march crash.
l7j9q6	37	66	Conclusion We are set up perfectly for a deep, violent correction.
l7j9q6	38	25	If you're a hibernating .
l7j9q6	39	21	, starving for some .
l7j9q6	40	112	porn, I have just the thing for you this could turn into a full on market crash if it really, really gets going.
l7j9q6	41	78	The more volatile the memes get, the more volatile the market is going to get.
l7j9q6	42	66	The more volatile the market gets, the more selling has to happen.
l7j9q6	43	255	The more selling, the more volatility, and boy does this escalate quickly For those of you budding autists and retards that were literally born yesterday, just know that this feedback loop has happened many times before, like this time almost a year ago .
l7j9q6	44	87	HOWEVER, I would also like to note that this is 1000% divorced from the actual economy.
l7j9q6	45	40	Any dip will be violent and short lived.
l7j9q6	46	51	Do not panic and BTFD, you smelly bundle of sticks.
l7j9q6	47	151	There's a lot of dry powder on the sidelines that missed the dip in march and are still pissed about it such as yours truly, who was too busy being a .
l7j9q6	48	78	, and they would LOVE a chance to buy back into the market at a low ish price.
l7j9q6	49	58	My recommendation Do NOT be levered to the tits right now.
l7j9q6	50	114	Maybe toss a few dollars into way OTM spy puts a few weeks out, or longer, as a hedge against your long positions.
l7j9q6	51	112	Do NOT go all in poots, cause stonks only go up and wall street is actively working on ways to defuse this bomb.
l7j9q6	52	67	But be ready for stonks to go down VERY quickly for a little while.
l7j9q6	53	51	It can happen, and if it does, it's gonna get ugly.
l7j9q6	54	117	My positions ALL IN GME, except for a bunch of March spy puts I'm gonna buy tomorrow cause I'm a gambling degenerate.

l7hne0	2	124	And you need to make a decision to execute or not by a certain time so wouldn't they try to hold price down until that time?
l7hne0	3	134	They can let price run up during the day but all that matters is price from 4 00 pm until whatever the drop dead decision time is, no?

l7gajy	0	61	SGMO DD Number 3 Event Timeline, Short Interest and Evidence.
l7gajy	1	12	WTF is SGMO?
l7gajy	2	24	Like Crispr, but better.
l7gajy	3	143	SGMO uses ZFNs zinc finger nucleases which are much more efficient, site specific less off target effects , and even able to edit mitochondria.
l7gajy	4	36	And they are miles ahead clinically.
l7gajy	5	77	For a more detailed explanation, feel free to read the first two DD I posted.
l7gajy	6	51	First one was when SGMO stock price was under $10 .
l7gajy	7	8	SGMO DD.
l7gajy	8	37	Crispr Patents, Valuation, and ARKG .
l7gajy	9	24	SGMO Investment Thesis .
l7gajy	10	19	But what do I know?
l7gajy	11	9	Not much.
l7gajy	12	176	But I'm relying on the fact that the 5 big pharmas that have partnerships with SGMO being able to deliver the goods, namely Pfizer, Kite, Takeda, Novartis, Sanofi, and Biogen .
l7gajy	13	94	Look at this sexy pipeline With 17 programs, one Phase 3, three Phase 1 2, it's a thick snacc.
l7gajy	14	75	I don't even need XHamster any more with this page out there, free to view.
l7gajy	15	129	Cancel your gamer girl only fans with bath water delivery, and instead stare at menage a 17 of collabs and wholly owned programs.
l7gajy	16	44	Compare it to CRSP's pipeline page 9 trials.
l7gajy	17	152	"And rather than list pre clinical, phase 1 2, and Phase 3 like most reputable biotechs do, theirs is a unique \"Research IND enabling Clinical Marketed\"."
l7gajy	18	93	"I'm all for self expression and every biotech is a beautiful snowflake, but \"IND enabling\"???"
l7gajy	19	12	Clinical????
l7gajy	20	23	EXACTLY HOW CLINICAL???
l7gajy	21	52	DID YOU WALK A VIAL THROUGH A CLINIC BY ACCIDENT????
l7gajy	22	126	Maybe they made up a pre Phase 1, like Phase 0.5 and they just thought it would be too avant garde to bust out at this moment.
l7gajy	23	83	Either way, it seems shady to choose to present your pipeline in such a unique way.
l7gajy	24	133	Also, I don't see 5 BP partnerships listed If SGMO is Xhamster, the CRSP pipeline is a local grannies in your area sidebar thumbnail.
l7gajy	25	195	BTW, all those biopharma partnerships are on contracts worth up to 7 Billion dollars in royalty and milestone payments And SGMO has its own programs for organ transplantation and Fabry's disease.
l7gajy	26	61	So when are some events that could make SGMO share price pop?
l7gajy	27	90	As I've said before I'm not Ms. Cleo, you can't call me now, and I don't know the future .
l7gajy	28	52	But I do know some significant dates are coming up .
l7gajy	29	75	1. First big one is Sanofi reporting more data from the SGMO collaboration.
l7gajy	30	52	This happens March 9th at 11 30am, but BE CAREFUL!!!
l7gajy	31	20	more on that below .
l7gajy	32	258	There was some initial data pointing to superiority of CRSP in this indication transfusion dependent beta thalassemia but what most analysts failed to realize or under emphasized was that CRSP achieved a better result via a highly toxic conditioning regimen.
l7gajy	33	94	So toxic in fact, one of the two patients they treated went septic an infection in the blood .
l7gajy	34	246	Without getting into it too much, this is ex viv0 editing where cells are edited outside the body and re infused with the genetic abnormality fixed, so it's very similar to chemo before an autologous you use your own cells bone marrow transplant.
l7gajy	35	139	1. Departure of Sung Lee has a curious little clause in an SEC submitted document about extending his stock options through the end of May.
l7gajy	36	185	Looks like he's leaving in February but his stock options are good through May 27th I normally don't wear a tinfoil hat just a life helmet but merger, buyout, new partnership who knows?
l7gajy	37	73	But any CFO not looking to get FO wouldn't dip on some incoming tendies .
l7gajy	38	77	2. Pfizer Hemophilia A phase 3 data at ASH 2021, typically held in Decembe r.
l7gajy	39	99	This is the flagship first to market program for SGMO and as far as I'm considered it's in the bag.
l7gajy	40	146	Albeit an N 5 sample set for dose cohort 4, an excellent dose response curve for an objectively measured result factor levels across dose cohorts.
l7gajy	41	131	"For you stonk apes, Phase 1 and 2 are \"dose finding\" studies where the first concern is safety, and Phase 3 is focused on efficacy."
l7gajy	42	168	Factor levels appear to wane over time, but in hemophilia the difference between severe and normal lifestyle can hinge on a marginal amount of clotting factor produced.
l7gajy	43	391	So although I wouldn't use the word cure outright, excluding re dosing tech coming down the pipeline this is a functional cure for X years in a patient population that not only experiences life threatening frank bleeds, but other debilitating symptoms secondary to small bleeds and clots arthralgias, limited quality of life , and ultra high cost factor infusions 100,000k per year for some.
l7gajy	44	277	And as far as safety efficacy is concerned, SGMO had one bleed 52 weeks out and Biomarin BMRN had so many bleeds and low unresponsive factor levels and intra patient variability that the FDA requested a more data when they tried to file for accelerated review and got rejected.
l7gajy	45	342	And in case you don't believe BMRN think's you're stupid and is doing everything they can to try and get their inferior product to market before SGMO, check out this graph of factor levels where coloration does not correspond to zero on the y axis to make its data look better I even think BMRN seems like a good candidate for some LEAP puts.
l7gajy	46	66	BMRN market cap is 15 Billion with 5 programs, one of which sucks.
l7gajy	47	36	SGMO is 2 billion with 17 programs .
l7gajy	48	16	SHORT INTEREST .
l7gajy	49	144	Normally I wouldn't post this given the difficulty of finding up to date, accurate short info, but given recent events I think it's of interest.
l7gajy	50	100	SGMO has had a longstanding short float, about 17 millions shares right now, about 11 days to cover.
l7gajy	51	188	Also, every major pop this stock has had due to good new or collaborations was methodically whittled away to the pre event price which is why I said BE VERY CAREFUL SURROUNDING MARCH 9th .
l7gajy	52	88	So although it can be tricky to trade, there's a metric shit ton of stuff not priced in.
l7gajy	53	150	And if you want to see real stock price manipulation in action , check out the share price on the following dates that correspond to the article pic .
l7gajy	54	134	12 7 12 10 Best in class hemophilia A results for SB 525 reported 12 7, premarket and SGMO opens $9.93 and closes at a loss for $9.05.
l7gajy	55	59	Positive beta thalassemia results reported 12 9, premarket.
l7gajy	56	93	Notice the run up doesn't happen until 12 10, A FULL 3 DAYS AFTER INITIAL HEME A TRIAL NEWS .
l7gajy	57	33	Sounds like enough time to cover.
l7gajy	58	49	Stock immediately pulls back after run up 12 10..
l7gajy	59	158	12 18 12 23 stock runs from low of $13.50 to high of $18.24 on announcement of Pfizer taking over heme A trial in phase 3 following stellar Phase 1 2 results.
l7gajy	60	69	Notice the run up starts 12 18, 5 DAYS BEFORE NEWS RELEASE ON 12 23 .
l7gajy	61	211	For record I posted my first DD on Sunday Dec 20th, with shares at $14.36 from the previous Friday, in full fucking disbelief that share price hadn't gone up from Heme A results and Pfizer takeover of the trial.
l7gajy	62	95	Next few days it rocketed to $18.64 before the shorts decided it was time to tap it down again.
l7gajy	63	35	Since then, red days on low volume.
l7gajy	64	31	Just taaaaaaap it down, shorts.
l7gajy	65	23	Give it a little tappy.
l7gajy	66	16	Tap tap taparoo.
l7gajy	67	89	YOLO Screenshot attached, and that's one of 3 accounts need to roll out those May calls .
l7gajy	68	54	SGMO is still the majority of my tradeable retirement.
l7gajy	69	71	TL DR. SGMO undervalued with proven gene editing tech headed to market.
l7gajy	70	112	Buying shares or LEAP Jan 22' and Jan 23' calls seems cool, but I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.
l7gajy	71	88	Selling some covered calls each month to buy more OTM LEAPs makes the time pass quicker.
l7gajy	72	6	YOLO .
l7gajy	73	8	Edit 1 .
l7gajy	74	226	Edit 2 I forgot I rushed this out because notorious dickhead JPM analyst Eric Joseph just upgraded PT to $35 after years of misrepresentation and shoddy research undervaluing SGMO, so I think he knows an upward move is coming.
l7g6gi	0	18	However this ends.
l7g6gi	1	33	We live in the greatest timeline!
l7fw0x	0	23	I used to work Merrill.
l7fw0x	1	97	Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short squeezing investors.
l7fw0x	2	146	I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset.
l7fw0x	3	45	Worked Merrill as an analyst from 2014 2016..
l7fw0x	4	47	I also like to keep it concise so follow along.
l7fw0x	5	39	This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.
l7fw0x	6	21	Disclaimer I own GME.
l7fw0x	7	29	This is not financial advice.
l7fw0x	8	53	This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.
l7fw0x	9	40	1 Robinhood, restrictions, suppression .
l7fw0x	10	148	When you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread However, the transaction is not complete.
l7fw0x	11	21	Enter Clearing house.
l7fw0x	12	67	The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter parties.
l7fw0x	13	133	Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.
l7fw0x	14	96	"The clearing house is who gives you the \"title\" for your shares, the folks who make it official."
l7fw0x	15	431	What Likely Happened The risk department retard the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C Suite frazzled He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert.
l7fw0x	16	23	It's simply not enough.
l7fw0x	17	149	In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own we ain't gonna help you.
l7fw0x	18	130	SEC is sneaky like that they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves.
l7fw0x	19	177	If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.
l7fw0x	20	249	"So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame liability if there's a \"failure to deliver\"?"
l7fw0x	21	22	2 Failure to Deliver .
l7fw0x	22	34	This is a pretty fucking big deal.
l7fw0x	23	69	Bigger than you imagine, because it's basically a slam dunk law suit.
l7fw0x	24	213	Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate.
l7fw0x	25	237	Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered?
l7fw0x	26	39	There simply isn't enough for everyone.
l7fw0x	27	76	Thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of failures to deliver big risk.
l7fw0x	28	13	3 Liability .
l7fw0x	29	27	You must be asking so what?
l7fw0x	30	192	Fuck them They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple.
l7fw0x	31	78	Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions.
l7fw0x	32	145	If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER.
l7fw0x	33	42	How many people have options on GME on RH?
l7fw0x	34	5	Half?
l7fw0x	35	157	Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house.
l7fw0x	36	33	There would be no Robinhood left.
l7fw0x	37	45	There would likely be no clearing house left.
l7fw0x	38	246	Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T Mobile, they had to pull the plug.
l7fw0x	39	100	Hence Bad Decision Bankruptcy or worse WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively .
l7fw0x	40	167	I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.
l7fw0x	41	30	Couple of semi related notes .
l7fw0x	42	18	Fuck Billionaires.
l7fw0x	43	135	Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people.
l7fw0x	44	57	them in the streets, them in the , them from skyscrapers.
l7fw0x	45	83	Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.
l7fw0x	46	179	I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel the HF would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC.
l7fw0x	47	107	They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this.
l7fw0x	48	148	It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker.
l7fw0x	49	119	If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?.
l7fw0x	50	120	The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line.
l7fw0x	51	18	Don't get engaged.
l7fw0x	52	22	Don't give in to them.
l7fw0x	53	77	Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall street however you please.
l7fw0x	54	73	The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive.
l7fw0x	55	171	TL DR There's simply not enough float and the broker clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.
l7fw0x	56	186	What will happen now Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday tomorrow will be nuts All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up up up up up.

l7c09m	1	282	Hello Congress MAN WOMAN NAME , I am a resident of CITY DISTRICT and I need you as my representative to call for an investigation into securities market manipulation by large hedge funds colluding with affiliated brokerage houses to cover the losses of their reckless short selling.
l7c09m	2	187	As you have likely seen in the news, retail investors have found a number of companies that they believe in and who have been the targets of relentless short selling by large hedge funds.
l7c09m	3	75	These include GameStop, Blackberry, and Bed, Bath and Beyond, among others.
l7c09m	4	245	A number of large hedge funds took notoriously risky short positions on these companies, in GameStop's case short selling more stock than had been issued on the market, effectively forcing these companies towards bankruptcy for their own profit.
l7c09m	5	211	But when a number of individual retail investors decided to take the other side of their trade and bet on these companies' recovery, the hedge funds decided they could not handle the risk they had signed up for.
l7c09m	6	451	"A number of brokerages affiliated with Citadel, who purchased a stake in Melvin Capital, one of the short sellers who took on the largest and riskiest positions, have ceased allowing their customers to buy shares in these companies in the name of controlling \"volatility.\" It is an utterly transparent move to help the hedge funds cover their positions at the expense of retail investors, yet another version of the inexhaustible Wall Street bailouts."
l7c09m	7	117	This is blatant collusion and market manipulation by large Wall Street firms happening right now and it cannot stand.
l7c09m	8	54	I demand an investigation into these unfair practices.
l7c09m	9	192	Congresswoman Tlaib of Michigan has publicly called for such an investigation and I am asking you to give her your full support in the endeavor to protect our markets and individual investors.

l7b6t7	2	23	GAMMA INFINITY SQUEEZE.
l7b6t7	3	18	Dear autist army,.
l7b6t7	4	107	I know most of you cannot read so I will keep it short and sweet, and I will include a TL CR at the bottom.
l7b6t7	5	72	I am not a financial advisor, so do what you will with this information.
l7b6t7	6	70	I am proud of every last one of you who have diamond handed until now.
l7b6t7	7	12	I really am.
l7b6t7	8	26	You are all good soldiers.
l7b6t7	9	31	Tomorrow is where we hold them!
l7b6t7	10	28	Tomorrow is where we fight!.
l7b6t7	11	101	"Tomorrow will go down in the history books as the \" GREAT BATTLE FOR VALHALLA \" in this Infinity War."
l7b6t7	12	13	Here is why .
l7b6t7	13	194	Similar to last week although last week set a record in financial history where every GME call strike closed itm , A LARGE PROPORTION OF CALL STRIKES WILL BE EXPIRING IN THE MONEY TOMORROW, 1 29
l7b6t7	14	102	21. WE WILL SEE A GAMMA SQUEEZE LIKE LAST FRIDAY THAT WILL PUSH THIS PAST THE ATH WE SAW THIS MORNING.
l7b6t7	15	62	I believe this could be the catalyst for the infinity squeeze.
l7b6t7	16	112	If you are a newly minted autist and you don't know what this means, it means that WE RIDE TO VALHALLA TOMORROW!
l7b6t7	17	26	Also, see the TL CR below.
l7b6t7	18	208	Additionally, because of the insane national and celebrity Elon, Ja Rule, Kanye attention GME has received, I suspect that whales will enter the fray tomorrow with big money just to stick it to Melvin, et al.
l7b6t7	19	233	"It is obvious that Citadel and Melvin coordinated their short attack with Robinhood at a time when most of us retards were powerless to buy according to Robinhood they will allow \"limited buys\" tomorrow whatever the fuck that means ."
l7b6t7	20	45	But do not fret my fellow tards, stay strong.
l7b6t7	21	70	They may have won the battle, but they have not won the infinity war!.
l7b6t7	22	47	Today scared off a lot of paper handed autists.
l7b6t7	23	181	If this is you, I can understand why you got scared like you do when your wife's boyfriend scolds you for leaving the refrigerator opened, or for forgetting to clean the litter box.
l7b6t7	24	60	That said, I must respectfully refuse to call you one of us.
l7b6t7	25	38	You are no member of this autist army.
l7b6t7	26	80	If you are a diamond handed retard, and you have followed orders, I salute you!.
l7b6t7	27	95	Kiss your wives, their boyfriends, and your children tonight, because tomorrow we go to battle.

l7b11b	75	26	They know they are losing.

l7b11b	77	47	Their only option left is to make us lose hope.

l7b11b	79	49	They have sold our shares without our permission.
l7b11b	80	97	They are manipulating the market to save a corporation at the expense of millions of real humans.
l7b11b	81	101	They have no problem crushing you and your future if it means another fucking dollar in their pocket.
l7b11b	82	62	For too long, they have profited and gambled with our economy.

l7aw89	0	110	Please Help Me Understand What Happened Today Multiple Orders Rejected by NYSE, Costing Me Tens of Thousands .
l7aw89	1	128	To preface this, yes I know the correct thing to do would have been to just hold, but that should not be the point of this post.
l7aw89	2	20	TL DR at the bottom.
l7aw89	3	149	I had one Jan 29 20c option I've been holding since GME was somewhere around 18, and I originally planned to exercise and I wish I followed my plan .
l7aw89	4	98	Today at market open, I got too nervous about the impending market manipulation and tried to sell.
l7aw89	5	152	1st Order Sell for 310 limit 30k profit on a $300 investment while there was a bid for 318 and the stock was at 320 no halt, this was right after open .
l7aw89	6	16	Order Rejected .
l7aw89	7	112	Stock started rising again and I was kinda glad the order didn't go through, even though it seemed really fishy.
l7aw89	8	145	"I later learned through my broker that the rejection code from NYSE basically meant my limit was \"too aggressive\" and that's why it was rejected."
l7aw89	9	5	WTF .
l7aw89	10	30	2nd Order 1200 Limit, fuck it.
l7aw89	11	21	Order open accepted .
l7aw89	12	71	In regards to the rejection justification for the first order top kek .
l7aw89	13	26	Stock starts free falling.
l7aw89	14	19	Mind starts racing.
l7aw89	15	55	Selling at 1200 would have been life changing directly.
l7aw89	16	108	Selling at 300 would allow for some great investments into myself that could be life changing down the line.
l7aw89	17	262	Selling at 100 would be a very nice profit still, even if it was just at 400 a few minutes ago, but who the fuck knows what kinda shady ass shit is going on behind the scenes at the moment while most US retail investors are basically shut out except for selling.
l7aw89	18	31	Stock hits 100 and halts again.
l7aw89	19	52	3rd Order Sell at 103 limit matching a current bid .
l7aw89	20	16	Order Executed .
l7aw89	21	27	Halt ends, stock shoots up.
l7aw89	22	73	Hole in stomach and panic sets in once again, but in the other direction.
l7aw89	23	33	Realize I've made a huge mistake.
l7aw89	24	51	4th Order Buy at 120 limit matching a current ask .
l7aw89	25	16	Order Rejected .
l7aw89	26	51	5th Order Buy at 140 limit matching a current ask .
l7aw89	27	16	Order Rejected .
l7aw89	28	51	4th Order Buy at 160 limit matching a current ask .
l7aw89	29	16	Order Rejected .
l7aw89	30	41	The contract is now too expensive for me.

l7aw89	32	85	Now, I made a 10k profit from a $300 investment and I don't want to bitch about that.
l7aw89	33	86	I'll be happy about it soon enough once I'm less emotional about what could have been.
l7aw89	34	51	But What the everloving fuck happened to my orders?
l7aw89	35	88	I've never had an order be rejected before, just maybe not filled if my limits were off.
l7aw89	36	253	Just so happens the only order that went through today was the worst one I made and all the others realistic ones got rejected, so I'm indeed salty especially the 310 sale in the morning didn't go through, as that basically cost me $20k, $10k if I held.
l7aw89	37	42	If I thought I could sue the NYSE I would.
l7aw89	38	139	So, can anyone explain to me what happened here so I can know what to expect and act accordingly if I'm ever in a similar situation again?.
l7aw89	39	61	Thanks and godspeed to all of you who are still in this game.

l7kgay	2	52	Let's show these Wall Street dicks who's in control.
l7kgay	3	16	Here's your DD .
l7kgay	4	179	Blackberry and Amazon On Dec. 1, Blackberry announced it had partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and bring to market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY.
l7kgay	5	107	Automakers will be able to use the software for the smart and autonomous electric vehicles being developed.
l7kgay	6	81	Blackberry and Zoom On Oct. 16, Blackberry announced it was partnering with Zoom.
l7kgay	7	155	Zoom will be using Blackberry's Blackberry Dynamics cybersecurity software in its mobile platform to protect companies from cyberattacks and data breaches.
l7kgay	8	166	Blackberry Dynamics software also provides secure video conferencing, which Blackberry says will become more necessary as companies move away from in person meetings.
l7kgay	9	139	Blackberry and Huawei Earlier this month, it was reported that Blackberry had sold 90 patents to Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.
l7kgay	10	150	Blackberry holds more patents than any other company in Canada, many that are applicable to smartphones that Blackberry no longer will concentrate on.
l7kgay	11	238	Blackberry and OnwardMobility Despite Blackberry moving away from smartphones, last August Blackberry announced it would be partnering with OnwardMobility to help the tech startup produce Blackberry branded smartphones with 5G technology.
l7kgay	12	65	The phones are set to be released in the first half of this year.
l7kgay	13	60	$BB closed at 14.65 on 1 28, with a previous close of 25.10.
l7kgay	14	54	$BB also faced restrictions on RH, so it must be good.
l7kgay	15	54	I believe within the coming months $BB will reach $50.
l7kgay	16	83	Note This is not financial advice, I am merely a monkey seeking moonfront property.

l7kdfw	4	130	I guarantee that all the Wall St CEOs know eachother well and they will start doing crazy shit tonight and during market tomorrow.
l7kdfw	5	48	To have any chance at this WE MUST HOLD AND BUY.
l7kdfw	6	275	If you want to contribute to the fight then go on and get some more stock, options won't save us because we are not in possession of the shares, the suits could use that to trade them between themselves and negotiate new longer short contracts so they can try to outlast us .
l7kdfw	7	76	Margin, as we have seen, will be terminated and given back to to the market.
l7kdfw	8	134	Switch to a good brokerage TD has worked for me if you want to buy more, but I beg you don't close positions on the old one if you do.

l7kw1i	0	90	PSA If you are holding GME calls that you plan to exercise, exercise them before closing!.
l7kw1i	1	146	We've seen how influential Melvin and the hedge funds are when it comes to changing the price of GameStop, and they know how influential they are.
l7kw1i	2	59	They know that at 4 00 EDT, all open options will exercise.
l7kw1i	3	139	This makes it an obvious play for the suits to try to push the stock price down before closing to make as many calls as possible worthless.
l7kw1i	4	192	If you exercise when you're at a very solid gain, this will help protect you as well as help people with higher strike prices make their break even point, which will cause for even more gains.
l7kw1i	5	136	Remember, GME is early in it's rise and will break the edge of the universe if Melvin &amp Friends get successfully squoze like a grape.
l7kw1i	6	163	"Also, remember to buy like you have no concept of money and we'll all become GMEllionaires before you can say, \"CRISPY HUNDO AINT NEVER GONNA BUY GAMESTOP . . . \"."
l7kw1i	7	108	Also pt.2, someone pointed out the possibility that Melvin may have had the audacity to sell us naked calls.
l7kw1i	8	97	If we exercise our calls, there's a very good chance that we can force them to put up more money.
l7kw1i	9	161	If you don't have the money to cover your incredibly profitable call then you better deposit the funds before your broker pulls a margin call and fucks you over.
l7kw1i	10	55	Exercise contracts, do it all throughout the day, and .

l7l928	2	98	I'll be short and honest with you, my fellow retards because I know our attention span is limited.
l7l928	3	47	I was very skeptical of GME from the beginning.
l7l928	4	134	I figured it would squeeze a little bit, the hedges would cover their asses, and the stock would fall as WSB moves onto its next meme.
l7l928	5	156	This has happened MANY times in the time of been with WSB, but what's different here is the stock pushed far enough that the hedges refused to eat the loss.
l7l928	6	32	Every single day I told myself .
l7l928	7	47	"\"Okay, all the hedges are gonna buy back right?"
l7l928	8	55	"There's no way short interest just remains this high\" ."
l7l928	9	19	But it fucking did.
l7l928	10	142	They fucked up SO bad that they began to silence not only our collective group of raging autism, but regular ass folk who just heard about it.
l7l928	11	89	All because they can't admit they fucked up and just eat the loss like honorable brokers.
l7l928	12	19	I'm pissed off now.
l7l928	13	127	Watching Vlad lie his ass off about why they shut down the trading of 13 OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRADED STOCKS was the final straw.

l7l928	18	123	With volatility so high are the contracts for different strikes even worth it after the premiums are thrown into overdrive?
l7l928	19	48	Or should I just go full shares to cover my ass?

l7n8xi	3	32	The price is around 290 350 USD.
l7n8xi	4	74	Volatility is high, so price can change by the seconds while writing this.
l7n8xi	5	124	Usually, stock price, especially for smaller caps, sticks to future pricing and aligns with US pre market trading once open.
l7n8xi	6	83	Also interesting, German broker Trade Republic has reversed the ban on trading GME.
l7n8xi	7	112	The firm said, restrictions were necessary to protect stability of trading systems, risk management and clients.
l7n8xi	8	190	Edit 1 Just to give an additional perspective, the last two days, GME opened green in Germany, went high and dropped to US prices when pre market trading opened still green but lower price .
l7n8xi	9	71	Edit 2 I also read news, that two chinese Brokers reallowed GME buying.

l7wv2c	0	10	READ THIS.
l7wv2c	1	16	When do we sell?
l7wv2c	2	27	A quick guide for GME Army.
l7wv2c	3	24	SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND .
l7wv2c	4	4	DD .
l7wv2c	5	43	Too much disinformation about when to sell.
l7wv2c	6	169	I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!
l7wv2c	7	58	so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.
l7wv2c	8	71	"First, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" ."
l7wv2c	9	21	Official definition .
l7wv2c	10	139	Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
l7wv2c	11	166	Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.
l7wv2c	12	72	A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.
l7wv2c	13	21	Dumbed down version .
l7wv2c	14	72	imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass.
l7wv2c	15	62	How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass?
l7wv2c	16	116	If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass.
l7wv2c	17	47	If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
l7wv2c	18	41	Same thing with covering short positions.
l7wv2c	19	87	How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions?
l7wv2c	20	138	"You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"."
l7wv2c	21	109	Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.
l7wv2c	22	7	6 days.
l7wv2c	23	9	6.3 days.
l7wv2c	24	10	5.78 days.
l7wv2c	25	177	So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.
l7wv2c	26	31	So what does that mean for us?.
l7wv2c	27	88	Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position.
l7wv2c	28	17	When is that day?
l7wv2c	29	18	VERY FUCKING SOON.
l7wv2c	30	231	They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM in the money calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.
l7wv2c	31	82	Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.
l7wv2c	32	105	Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS.
l7wv2c	33	176	Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!
l7wv2c	34	104	So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday.
l7wv2c	35	22	No need to panic sell.
l7wv2c	36	52	No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes.
l7wv2c	37	26	It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!
l7wv2c	38	169	Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it.
l7wv2c	39	24	It takes DAYS to do so!.
l7wv2c	40	61	The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio.
l7wv2c	41	52	If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun.
l7wv2c	42	76	If it's still at fucking 138 140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.
l7wv2c	43	82	We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet!
l7wv2c	44	21	Imagine when they do?
l7wv2c	45	70	$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.
l7wv2c	46	116	If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.
l7wv2c	47	68	TL DR ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD.
l7wv2c	48	39	WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!.
l7wv2c	49	18	Edit Why trust me?

l7wmcl	1	7	PT $550
l7wl0j	0	121	For those doubtful of GME short squeeze just know that no one is questioning the strategy except CNBC and their friends .
l7wl0j	1	16	So buy and hold.
l7wl0j	2	149	There is no mechanism in the stock market that allows shorters to get out without buying back ALL the shares that's currently floating on the market.
l7wl0j	3	158	In fact, they're short on the shares they need to buy, because a good portion is held by institutions, ETF's, and Gamestop executives who will never sell all.
l7wl0j	4	34	And they're still short over 100%.
l7wl0j	5	40	Shareholders literally decide the price.
l7wl0j	6	70	They need to buy everything that's available to trade, no matter what.
l7wl0j	7	71	Currently, they're propping themselves up by borrowing on 65% interest.
l7wl0j	8	47	65% interest on borrowed money in the billions!
l7wl0j	9	44	They will fold eventually, most likely soon.
l7wl0j	10	148	I admit that no one can see into the future, no one knows with 100% certainty how exactly things will go down, but that goes for all things in life.
l7wl0j	11	177	If you're still doubtful, even if you just put in $20 in fractional shares, you can likely sell it for any price you set it to when they cave and the squeeze inevitably happens.
l7wl0j	12	51	EDIT Answering some questions in the comments here.
l7wl0j	13	122	Hedge funds, brokerages, etc. are all lawfully required to own insurance, you will definitely get paid one way or another.
l7wl0j	14	71	It is against the law for brokerages to not pay out to you if you sell.

l7wj2o	1	53	Now up to a million of these could be bots who knows.

l7wj2o	4	75	We have more troops in the heat of this war than we had when we started it.
l7wj2o	5	142	It only takes 3% to start a revolution but when they make a stand, it shows the other 97% that it costs nothing to be a patriot and join them.
l7wj2o	6	34	Just remember what Goku taught us.
l7wj2o	7	22	Show mercy at the end.
l7wj2o	8	53	Let them choose whether or not to destroy themselves.
l7wj2o	9	49	Always give them the opportunity to admit defeat.

l7rgjd	0	73	Why GME dipped yesterday and why Holding the line matters more than ever.
l7rgjd	1	76	Hello dear autists and some new joiners who are about to hop on the train ,.
l7rgjd	2	53	This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history.
l7rgjd	3	135	The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel Robinhood Point72 StevenCohen collusion yesterday.
l7rgjd	4	178	For those who missed what happened Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders.
l7rgjd	5	124	This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.
l7rgjd	6	141	It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top.
l7rgjd	7	81	This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades.
l7rgjd	8	16	A short ladder .
l7rgjd	9	29	A short ladder was initiated.
l7rgjd	10	103	They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices.
l7rgjd	11	127	They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions initiated at ATH .
l7rgjd	12	89	This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal.
l7rgjd	13	100	These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap.
l7rgjd	14	80	Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally from 140 percent to 120 percent .
l7rgjd	15	132	The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy.
l7rgjd	16	43	So now we know that this is what they want.
l7rgjd	17	21	They want us to sell.
l7rgjd	18	54	And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell.
l7rgjd	19	34	The short ladder was one of those.
l7rgjd	20	18	So what can we do?
l7rgjd	21	23	And how will it matter?
l7rgjd	22	43	We do the opposite of what they want us to.
l7rgjd	23	14	We don't sell.
l7rgjd	24	37	How will this help the short squeeze?
l7rgjd	25	75	Not selling and letting the buyers pile in will add to the buying pressure.
l7rgjd	26	26	It will also reduce float.
l7rgjd	27	120	So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.
l7rgjd	28	45	So hear me out here let's do some quick math.
l7rgjd	29	73	Short interest no of shares shorted no of available in float 120 percent.
l7rgjd	30	54	There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought.
l7rgjd	31	70	Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in.
l7rgjd	32	72	In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float this is my hunch .
l7rgjd	33	78	We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo.
l7rgjd	34	60	All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float.
l7rgjd	35	59	Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute.
l7rgjd	36	67	The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too.
l7rgjd	37	52	By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more.
l7rgjd	38	45	By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood.
l7rgjd	39	12	To Valhalla.
l7rgjd	40	12	Or the Moon.

l7nymc	2	191	If so, call your broker sorry if your amateur ass broker defaulted on their cricket wireless bill and no longer supports phone calls and tell them you want to exercise the option immediately.
l7nymc	3	119	They will give you lots of warnings that the stock could fall below the exercise price and you should wait until close.
l7nymc	4	99	If you're absolutely sure $GME isn't going to drop below the strike price, agree to exercise early.
l7nymc	5	30	This means two things happen .
l7nymc	6	90	1. Your contract will get executed even if the market completely shits the bed at closing.

l844bn	0	52	Capitalistic Version of a Re distribution of Wealth.
l844bn	1	149	I think we all know there's been a major change over the past years wherein The People have been pushing for a more fair and equal country and world.
l844bn	2	229	There's been support for versions of socialism, that some may or may not agree with, primarily because people want to be cared for and live in a just, non corrupt world where each individual has equal opportunities to prosperity.
l844bn	3	176	Going back to the beginning of human kind when there is an absence of leadership or care for the citizens of a tribe, The People always find a way to fight back for themselves.
l844bn	4	89	I personally believe there's been a lack of effective leadership for awhile in the world.
l844bn	5	132	We have wanted a more equitable world and, at least in America, there hasn't yet been an effective way to reverse income inequality.
l844bn	6	143	Now, while our current situation maybe isn't the end all, it is so incredible to me because we are seeing The People fight back for themselves.
l844bn	7	131	The governments of the world have seemingly pushed back on the redistribution of concentrated wealth via a more socialistic agenda.
l844bn	8	47	So what did this r wallstreetbets community do?
l844bn	9	172	Utilized the tools capitalism at our current disposal to trigger a redistribution of wealth, from Hedge Funds that bet against our economy to the everyday retail investor .
l844bn	10	44	I truly hope this is a new day in the world.

l83any	0	76	Common Sense Regulation by a Retard Because CNBC Guests Won't Talk About It.
l83any	1	62	I have had CNBC up 24 7 to watch the shitshow happen on there.
l83any	2	108	I know I shouldn't be to support our boi u deepfuckingvalue, but I gotta know how the opposition is looking.
l83any	3	113	"The common thread among most of the supporters of big money is this \"Let the SEC figure out how to regulate this."
l83any	4	24	I don't want to comment.
l83any	5	65	"\" Even AOC's stream, including her guests, wouldn't say anything."
l83any	6	57	I think it's very important we voice our opinion on this.
l83any	7	44	We need to let regulators know what WE want.
l83any	8	34	If you disagree, you can downvote.
l83any	9	34	That's the great thing about this.
l83any	10	147	I have 10 years of game design experience and at the end of the day, Wall Street is a game with rules, so I felt like I could give us a voice here.
l83any	11	56	So let's make the rules a bit more fair and less broken.
l83any	12	49	So my policy idea is simple Cash Secured Shorts .
l83any	13	22	Puts are cash secured.
l83any	14	24	Why shouldn't shorts be?
l83any	15	42	Unlimited downside is monumentally stupid.
l83any	16	51	We've seen that concept broken down with this play.
l83any	17	23	So how would this work?
l83any	18	8	Simple .
l83any	19	70	When someone places a short, they have to set a max cash loss with it.
l83any	20	72	This amount is cash secured and set aside so long as your short is live.
l83any	21	70	This can be either done as a monetary value or a stop loss style tool.
l83any	22	116	If you want to sell options into that, you can, but if your stop loss triggers, the option is market purchased back.
l83any	23	24	Much like a Margin Call.
l83any	24	103	The short can still lose more than the cash secured amount, but it will be small enough to account for.
l83any	25	70	It won't have infinite downside and will constrict mass short selling.
l83any	26	10	Benefits .
l83any	27	99	1. This allows short sellers to bet down without letting them do naked shorts with insane leverage.
l83any	28	58	2. There will never be a solvency issue with shorts again.
l83any	29	25	At least not from shorts.
l83any	30	65	3. Short based market manipulation will become much, much harder.
l83any	31	6	Cons .
l83any	32	72	1. This does not solve over trading the float which is not the problem .
l83any	33	41	You can still get 140% float with shorts.
l83any	34	31	At least it'll be cash secured.
l83any	35	95	2. Short selling strategies will become much more limiting, due to having to put up collateral.
l83any	36	77	3. Short squeezes can still occur and will be far easier to trigger this way.
l83any	37	106	I think this will make short sellers think twice about trades they make and the 140% problem will go away.
l83any	38	106	4. It takes a little bit of work for brokerages to build a new system to change the way shorts are traded.
l83any	39	33	5. Education will have to happen.
l83any	40	83	Fortunately it's usually only big money that shorts, so they'll figure it out fast.
l83any	41	84	From a user experience perspective, this isn't a difficult addition to their system.
l83any	42	75	Cash secured puts are already in place, so the monetary hold can be reused.
l83any	43	96	They will have to add a new bar that incorporates a selection tool for their cash secured value.
l83any	44	101	This is more complex UI than just allowing a straight sale of a shorted stock, but it's only one row.
l83any	45	49	They can manage that in any brokerage app system.
l83any	46	99	I believe my system will save the market from ever experiencing another short based solvency issue.
l83any	47	142	Margin can still be traded into shorts, but that becomes hedged by the people offering the margin, thus still keeping everything cash secured.
l83any	48	69	If you have anything you'd like to add to this or correct, feel free.
l83any	49	51	Let's give the regulators something to work off of.
l83any	50	138	"Many don't seem to even know how this system works, so we can't leave it up to big money to \"teach\" them what they need to do to fix this."
l83any	51	64	"We'll end up getting screwed in the name of \"retail protection\"."
l83any	52	41	If anyone can help share this, please do.
l83any	53	21	I don't have Twitter.
l83any	54	125	I think getting this upvoted will spread the idea and I'm hoping Youtubers and other people spread it or at least discuss it.
l83any	55	9	HOLD GME!

l7ut8d	4	77	I plan on buying the NASDAQ one on Monday to legally stick it to Wall Street.
l7ut8d	5	26	Already sent in the order.
l7ut8d	6	16	My question is .
l7ut8d	7	119	I can probably afford a few hours, but what if we buy it out until the end of the week, the month, hell, even the year?
l7ut8d	8	140	I did the math, it's not that expensive to run it for 1 hour per day and the impact will be way higher than putting that money in the stock.
l7ut8d	9	86	I'll do it anyway for Monday Tuesday, but if this catches on, I plan to keep it going.
l7ut8d	10	35	Just looking for some feedback now.
l7ut8d	11	16	THIS IS THE WAY?

l7ua4j	1	56	So I want to hop on the train and stick it to the suits!
l7ua4j	2	62	With that being said, I already had a fidelity account set up.
l7ua4j	3	87	I decided today to transfer money from my bank account to my fidelity account to trade.
l7ua4j	4	113	The problem is, the money is still technically processing at my bank but fidelity says I have the money to trade.
l7ua4j	5	229	"When I actually go to trade it, I get a warning that says \"The buy order you are about to place exceeds your settled cash balance. Selling these shares before paying in full for the trade could result in a Good Faith Violation.\"."
l7ua4j	6	84	Am I okay to purchase BB with my money I transferred to fidelity from my bank today?
l7ua4j	7	43	I'm not planning on selling anything today.
l7ua4j	8	97	I have just never encountered this issue because I typically use fidelity for my retirement plan.
l7ua4j	9	66	EDIT Just purchased 6 BB shares with that money and had no issues.
l7ua4j	10	134	If anyone else is in the same situation, I believe it only applies to if you buy and then SELL your stocks without the money clearing.
l7ua4j	11	27	Thanks for everyone's help!

l7t8lj	0	39	1 29 Friday Stock Market Movers & News.
l7t8lj	1	63	Good morning traders and investors of the r wallstreetbets sub!
l7t8lj	2	18	Welcome to Friday.
l7t8lj	3	48	Here are your pre market movers & news this AM .
l7t8lj	4	55	4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday .
l7t8lj	5	70	1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street's volatile week continues.
l7t8lj	6	215	The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday's open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one dose coronavirus vaccine.
l7t8lj	7	69	The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions.
l7t8lj	8	126	Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.
l7t8lj	9	119	The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday's 633 point decline, the worst one session drop since late October.
l7t8lj	10	102	Ahead of Friday's trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month.
l7t8lj	11	128	Three Dow stocks Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron reported quarterly earnings before the bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.
l7t8lj	12	63	2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants.
l7t8lj	13	229	J&J's highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid 19 cases among the phase three trial's more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa.
l7t8lj	14	116	J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults.
l7t8lj	15	188	If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna's, both of which are two doses.
l7t8lj	16	135	U.S. based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid
l7t8lj	17	163	19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K.
l7t8lj	18	128	However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country.
l7t8lj	19	58	Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday's premarket.
l7t8lj	20	81	3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading.
l7t8lj	21	215	Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.
l7t8lj	22	208	The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.
l7t8lj	23	131	Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue.
l7t8lj	24	124	After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday's premarket, respectively.
l7t8lj	25	66	4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure.
l7t8lj	26	163	Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks.
l7t8lj	27	70	Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help.
l7t8lj	28	283	Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour.
l7t8lj	29	64	Failure would be a high profile setback early in his presidency.

l7t58i	0	39	AMC STRONG BUY W ZACKS RESEARCH $21 PT.
l7t58i	1	26	Friends and fellow tards,.
l7t58i	2	56	The shiny sky circle has landed upon us for another day.
l7t58i	3	77	The gods and lord musk have boosted the computer Penny back to strong levels.
l7t58i	4	42	GME and AMC are having strong pre markets.
l7t58i	5	125	AMC has had volume that is baffling, and today on top of being less restricted it has obtained a price target of $21 dollars.
l7t58i	6	126	I think this is substantial because alot of investors and firms are being steered away from these shares we are battling over.
l7t58i	7	162	If more analysts and firms stop the restrictions we could really do what we set out to do and we can attempt to follow a similar trend to our video game brethren.
l7t58i	8	67	after all movies and video games are so nice for our smooth brains.
l7t58i	9	241	I expect some of our less successful, more analytically inclined friends to start to back our rally and yes, even those fucking silver haired boomer fucks may join in with AMC because they even partook in such fuckery as middle aged autists.
l7t58i	10	83	hell even some of our older WSB fuckers may have been conceived during movie panky.
l7t58i	11	93	Retards, fundamentalists, boomers and anything that identifies as something that can breathe.
l7t58i	12	29	buy and hold AMC to the moon.

l7t58i	19	50	Extra edit for necessary disclosure, I'm retarded.
l7t58i	20	23	probably more than you.
l7t58i	21	41	and this is not financial advice from me.

l7t0ej	0	69	FYI If you are logged into Fidelity, you can view the order book here
l7sx9e	0	76	It's time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share.
l7sx9e	1	206	This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent 'systemic risk'. The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.
l7sx9e	2	172	Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.
l7sx9e	3	52	Isn't $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?
l7sx9e	4	88	Just like last time you can 'put rules in place to make sure this won't happen again'. .
l7sx9e	5	178	In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn't bail them out, so the government did it.
l7sx9e	6	91	We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.
l7sx9e	7	109	By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.
l7sx9e	8	62	Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?
l7sx9e	9	105	Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?.
l7sx9e	10	159	Edit because it got attention if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.
l7sx9e	11	41	They would have to pay it back over time.
l7sx9e	12	144	The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors.
l7sx9e	13	161	Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function, and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again.
l7sx9e	14	146	The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.

l8i9yx	0	43	Prepare yourselves for a bloody red Monday.
l8i9yx	1	139	Never has it been so blatantly obvious the markets have been manipulated in favour for the rich, the lions have awoken and they want blood.
l8i9yx	2	120	Everything that has unfolded this past week from the media, the exchanges, the hedge funds and the big money at the top.
l8i9yx	3	54	The 1% are under fire, from regulators and bankruptcy.
l8i9yx	4	66	This GME situation is unprecedented and will forever make history.
l8i9yx	5	128	If they're going down, they're taking us with them, the volatility we're all about to see will be known for generations to come.
l8i9yx	6	190	If they don't go down because the regulators are as usual favouring the rich, and making it harder for the average folk to make money, there WILL be pitchforks from all corners of the world.
l8i9yx	7	144	The world is watching and enough is enough, the system is rigged, the people have had it and will no longer tolerate this inequality any longer.
l8i9yx	8	47	Prepare yourselves, the blood is about to rain.
l8i9yx	9	38	I hope everyone has an emergency fund.
l80aqa	0	34	GME ITM Options that expire today?
l80aqa	1	24	Am I missing something?.
l80aqa	2	124	So from what I understand is to day a crap ton of options that are ITM from around $200 strike price will need to be bought.
l80aqa	3	46	I can be wrong but around 20M shares in total.
l80aqa	4	132	I am just trying to understand the Volume we are having to day is extremely low compared to our past week of like 100 200M each day.
l80aqa	5	45	I know we have restriction problems going on.
l80aqa	6	88	Like I said I can be wrong but from my understanding 20M shares need to be bought today.
l80aqa	7	106	With our current volume traded today I don't see how the hedge funds have already covered these ITM calls.
l80aqa	8	22	Or who ever owns them.
l80aqa	9	53	Could they have already bought the shares yesterday?.
l80aqa	10	96	I mean shouldn't we see a spike with the last couple hours of everyone covering those ITM calls?
l806ec	0	64	1 29 Market Dynamics, GME Should be $1000 , Systemic Risk Fears.
l806ec	1	17	Watch out today!.
l806ec	2	164	TLDR Today's movements are a combination of panic around systemic failure Monday, with some selling of winners to buy GME and other meme stocks by the broad market.
l806ec	3	53	It's also the VIX Risk Parity unwind trade happening.
l806ec	4	107	My opinions a GME would be 4 digits if not for the factors today around calls and shares being hard to buy.
l806ec	5	312	So it could be 4 digits Monday, depending upon regulatory actions b we are risking a real financial crisis here if GME does get to 4 digits, c the fed & treasury dept are likely to intervene Monday and don't want this bubble, but dare only attack it indirectly, D there's going to be over regulation out of this.
l806ec	6	103	Positions was short when I wrote, now long VIX to hedge catastrophe, but strongly long ES into weekend.
l806ec	7	41	We are seeing today is a bunch of things.
l806ec	8	60	It's a little similar to what we saw Tuesday and Wednesday .
l806ec	9	45	A lot of selling on fear of systemic failure.
l806ec	10	109	What is different though is that on Tues Wed it was hedge funds covering shorts while dropping their winners.
l806ec	11	107	You can see this in the movement of GVIP which is an ETF that mechanically picks hedge fund long favorites.
l806ec	12	82	It underperformed market dramatically on those days, then overperformed yesterday.
l806ec	13	37	Today it is performing around market.
l806ec	14	60	You also see winners being dumped by retail to now buy GME .
l806ec	15	34	I think that's clear in the chart.
l806ec	16	147	Lastly, there's a risk parity trade and momo trade around VIX going on it's fear, risk parity trade, and retail dumping their favorites to buy GME.
l806ec	17	31	Explaining all in detail here .
l806ec	18	46	Why I think GME would be 1000 Today Normally .
l806ec	19	30	It's hard to buy call options.
l806ec	20	126	They are the leverage that makes this go up fast, multiplicatively with the narrow effective float now and the short interest.
l806ec	21	106	We aren't gamma squeezing as much, but it's still multiplicative in a way other parts of the trade aren't.
l806ec	22	56	Today, there's restricted buy and IV is realy expensive.
l806ec	23	113	, and there are dealers selling 5m net shares as calls roll off probably , and you can't get options most places.
l806ec	24	32	And the stock is still up a ton.
l806ec	25	127	That to me means without the unwind, and with options broadly available, and buys unrestricted, we'd be at $1000 today or more.
l806ec	26	110	Of course, we all know it's a bubble, and bubbles only sustain as long as net capital to the bubble increases.
l806ec	27	29	We surely are near the peak .
l806ec	28	27	after which it must unwind.
l806ec	29	132	But, regardless of the true outcome, we'd be at a much higher price today if not for all of these negative price dynamics piled on .
l806ec	30	69	limited new call options, trading restrictions, Friday option unwind.
l806ec	31	31	That leads me to my next point.
l806ec	32	24	Systemic Failure Fears .
l806ec	33	45	This GME thing is allowing a ton of leverage.
l806ec	34	48	Shorts leverage the stock with their 140% short.
l806ec	35	29	Longs are leveraged on calls.
l806ec	36	216	You put those together, and total GME leverage might be 40 or 50 or 60x at times when options were cheap less now, but still significant , and it has further unpredictability around a failure to deliver option trade.
l806ec	37	204	Also, should illiquidity be created where there aren't really GME shares to sell, and dealers have to buy frantically or shorts are forced by dealers to cover, you'll see tons of forced selling elsewhere.
l806ec	38	81	Selling causes more selling, that selling causes vix spike, which causes selling.
l806ec	39	120	and that in turn means people who were OK on gme short now must cover because the rest of their portfolio is underwater.
l806ec	40	123	What might have been 15b to cover suddenly becomes 100b to cover, and other portfolios with no exposure to GME blow up too.
l806ec	41	283	You put that all together, and there are real fears that this can cause a bankruptcy or at least lack of liquidity for any of Brokers remember, Robinhood almost ran out of money yesterday , Market Makers, and also random carnage across institutions that are short or long on margin .
l806ec	42	58	It's impossible to forecast this, and models are breaking.
l806ec	43	154	In other words, people are scared, even though the total bubble here is only a about 10 billion dollars of capital really exchanged at the end of the day.
l806ec	44	47	But, this could cause contagion at this point .
l806ec	45	201	if a good amount of brokers, clearing houses, and or market makers blew up, which I think is on the table if GME is in the thousands, the entire market gets de stabilized for a while until it's fixed .
l806ec	46	106	trades won't clear, accounts locked, sudden drop in all liquidity, and a lot of loss of trust for a while.
l806ec	47	54	This is analogous to pinching an artery or something .
l806ec	48	160	the damage hits the basic infrastructure that allow the markets to function if it gets much worse, and there's a recovery period even if the damage isn't fatal.
l806ec	49	71	This is why I think the market is selling off so hard today primarily .
l806ec	50	75	no one wants to hold risk into a GME $1000 monday, unless you are long GME.
l806ec	51	11	Also note .
l806ec	52	44	as GME goes lower today, SPX is stabilizing.
l806ec	53	67	The less chance it goes to $1000 , the les chance of systemic risk.
l806ec	54	72	But, without the net option selling today, it likely would be up double.
l806ec	55	39	With new call options on, I think more.
l806ec	56	93	Which of course begs the question of if the regulators will allow for call options on Monday.
l806ec	57	54	But, this clearly has upwards pressure that is strong.
l806ec	58	13	Hedge Funds .
l806ec	59	72	Hedge funds had to cover shorts and dump longs to stay properly levered.
l806ec	60	41	You saw that with the GVIP dump tues wed.
l806ec	61	20	No longer the case .
l806ec	62	104	so hedge funds are either well hedged, or aren't really the ones being forced to cover shorts right now.
l806ec	63	36	But they definitely took big damage.
l806ec	64	18	Retail GME Trade .
l806ec	65	133	A lot of retail favorites are selling off more today, like Disney, various favored day trading stocks that aren't current memes, etc.
l806ec	66	47	That's adding some vol as people rotate to GME.
l806ec	67	37	VIX and Risk Parity, Momentum Funds .
l806ec	68	86	Whenever vol of a stock in the S&P 500 goes up, the S&P 500 vix also has to go up too.
l806ec	69	210	There's a class of funds called 'risk parity funds' that basically try to adjust their allocation on risk reward basis, so when vix goes up, they assume the risk of S&P 500 went up, so they allocate less to it.
l806ec	70	19	this sends it down.
l806ec	71	15	increasing vix.
l806ec	72	79	There are also momentum funds that see this happening and just chase the trend.
l806ec	73	32	That further adds momentum down.
l806ec	74	89	People aren't going to calm down significantly until systemic risk is off the table here.
l806ec	75	25	My Views on Fed Actions .
l806ec	76	57	This is a financial crisis about to happen in plain view.
l806ec	77	70	The fed will take action to stop it, because it's obviously happening.
l806ec	78	214	They can do this very easily with lines of credit to brokers and clearing houses and market makers, and can also stop the cycle by keeping call options off on GME potentially, but that's more politically dangerous.
l806ec	79	90	In any case, I think the feds will find a solution that takes systemic risk off the table.
l806ec	80	34	They acted very fast during COVID.
l806ec	81	71	I think good chance they do it Sunday before market, then do it Monday.
l806ec	82	40	If they don't, Monday could become ugly.
l806ec	83	176	I think the Fed will want the GME bubble to die, but they also don't want the political heat for blowing up a trade that's symbolic of political activism for a bunch of people.
l806ec	84	136	My sense is their only move is to just squeeze the option market to make it so few calls get created, while also restricting new shorts.
l806ec	85	59	If calls are fully restored, this goes very high very fast.
l806ec	86	85	Restricting shorts does make it go higher too as it reliably ends the short interest.
l806ec	87	82	Realistically though, the fed and treasury want this to stop, and will be cunning.
l806ec	88	22	How I'm Trading This .
l806ec	89	264	It's possible this gets resolved, or the fed does something now, or people BTFD with all the money, but I think this is a situation that could quickly make a 5% market move or a vix spike to the 40s again we had 37 just 2 or 3 days ago at the close into the close.
l806ec	90	98	So I don't really want to be long with anything 0dte and I'm currently effectively short long vix.
l806ec	91	212	I expect to switch long on my theory of fed support near or after the close, and a lot of people will be freaked out at the idea of carrying over weekend risk into the potential of GME at $1000 blowing things up.
l806ec	92	82	As I mentioned above, if SPX looked stable enough, I'd rotate long for next week .
l806ec	93	63	but would hold my VIX calls to near or at close no matter what.
l806ec	94	16	Overregulation .
l806ec	95	86	The government will not let this crisis go to waste and will absolutely over regulate.
l806ec	96	30	Expect sensible changes like .
l806ec	97	100	things that make shorting harder, and make it harder to have huge amounts of open interest of calls.
l806ec	98	47	But they may over do it or do unrelated things.
l806ec	99	145	This will make our options trading hobby less fun unfortunately, because options will tend to be less accessible, more expensive and less potent.
l806ec	100	27	Yeah, I'm a bear sometimes.
l806ec	101	53	I'm actually up 50% YTD despite my horrid GME shorts.
l806ec	102	92	I like taking the plausible bets that win big when they work, and cost less when they don't.
l806ec	103	23	IT's the WSB mentality.
l806ec	104	50	I have a very small long term put position on GME.
l806ec	105	30	I am long ES, long vol hedge .
l806ec	106	38	Obviously this isn't financial advice.
l806ec	107	73	I know nothing about you, your risk tolerance, etc, which are key inputs.
l806ec	108	30	Also, the market is uncertain.
l806ec	109	72	This is just my view of what might happen and what has happened and why.
l7zxtj	0	97	GameStop short sellers are still not surrendering despite nearly $20 billion in losses this month
l7zkf9	0	28	Misconceptions and bullshit.
l7zkf9	1	123	This post might rub people the wrong way but I think it's important to make sure accurate information is getting out there.
l7zkf9	2	108	Not financial advice, stop messaging me asking what to do with your rent money, just go blow your landlord .
l7zkf9	3	59	Shorts couldn't have covered because short interest is up!.
l7zkf9	4	16	This isn't true.
l7zkf9	5	154	Suppose Melvin started covering their $20 shorts on Tuesday afternoon around $100 and continued to cover as the price was squeezed up to $200 after hours.
l7zkf9	6	133	That night margin calls go out and on Wednesday morning all the small shorts cover or get liquidated, squeezing the price up to $350.
l7zkf9	7	97	During that time institutions possibly including Melvin open up new shorts between $250 and $350.
l7zkf9	8	138	Short volume increases but those new short positions aren't in any danger of getting squeezed unless retail drives the price to $400 $500.
l7zkf9	9	158	Short interest alone does not mean more squeezing is possible you have to consider borrowing rates, entry points, and the number of involved institutions too.
l7zkf9	10	57	Shorts couldn't have covered because volume was too low!.
l7zkf9	11	14	Also not true.
l7zkf9	12	71	The volume you see reported comes from the Consolidated Tape Plan CTP .
l7zkf9	13	246	Exchanges and ECNs dark pools are required to report trade information as it happens to the CTP for aggregation and redistribution out to all institutions and brokers, who then pass it down to their clients in the form of price and volume graphs.
l7zkf9	14	72	But not all trading happens on venues that are subject to CTP reporting.
l7zkf9	15	125	For example, Gabe Plotkin of Melvin could have simply called a few hedge fund buddies he knows to be long GME and cut a deal.
l7zkf9	16	284	He could also have gone to a Citadel and directly swapped out his shorts for higher priced shorts, paying the difference as a premium sort of like rolling a short call out and having Citadel's market maker operations cover from their book at the cost of liquidity for retail traders .
l7zkf9	17	78	Or he could have used Citadel's loan to buy calls to collateralize his shorts.
l7zkf9	18	50	CTA reported volume does not tell the whole story.
l7zkf9	19	50	Keep buying and we'll squeeze out the new shorts!.
l7zkf9	20	69	Retail buying power is probably going to get exhausted at some point.
l7zkf9	21	109	"The initial argument for the GME squeeze was \"Hey look, this company is undervalued, overshorted, and cheap\"."
l7zkf9	22	92	Now the valuation is much higher and it's no longer cheap enough for retail to move easily .
l7zkf9	23	114	and especially calls, calls are so expensive now that gamma squeezing to initiate a short squeeze is a lot harder.
l7zkf9	24	57	Squeezing shorts that got in at $400 is going to be hard.
l7zkf9	25	71	And if you did squeeze them out, they will short again at $500 or $600.
l7zkf9	26	104	The higher the price and the less unreasonable the short entry points, the harder it will be to squeeze.
l7zkf9	27	53	Market makers will have to buy tons of shares today!.
l7zkf9	28	27	Probably not, to be honest.
l7zkf9	29	126	Market makers adjust their positions dynamically to remain delta neutral, they don't just wait until the last minute to hedge.
l7zkf9	30	142	Sometimes like during gamma squeezes they fall behind and they get stuck with a directional position on the stock, and have to catch up later.
l7zkf9	31	134	But yesterday's conveniently timed retail trader lockout kept gamma low and prices suppressed so there was plenty of time to catch up.
l7zkf9	32	176	You never know what could happen after hours, especially if a lot of options a right at the money, but don't expect market maker hedging to kick off a subsequent short squeeze.
l7zkf9	33	18	So I should sell?.
l7zkf9	34	164	I'm not saying that, you just need to come up with a new reason for your decision, because I think the initial thesis has more or less been satisfied by this point.
l7zkf9	35	55	Here are some reasons you might decide to hold or buy .
l7zkf9	36	58	1. You think Gamestop the company is undervalued at $350..
l7zkf9	37	76	2. You think squeezing shorts that got in between $250 and $350 is possible.
l7zkf9	38	122	3. You think there is money to be made on volatility over the coming weeks, such as more gamma squeezing of market makers.
l7zkf9	39	89	4. You think the media coverage will lead to more FOMO and you want to ride the momentum.
l7zkf9	40	114	5. You think my reasoning is bullshit and the $20 shorts didn't actually cover yet and are about to be liquidated.
l7zkf9	41	22	6. You like the stock.
l7zkf9	42	155	You want to be a long term Gamestop shareholder, own part of the company, take part in proxy votes, etc. and benefit from long term growth of the business.
l7zkf9	43	110	7. You want to make a moral statement about hedge funds, market makers, brokers, and the dirty pool they play.
l7zkf9	44	97	If any of that rings true to you then take out a second mortgage on your house and buy that shit.
l7zkf9	45	14	Don't do that.
l7zkf9	46	22	!Actually yes do that!
l7zgdk	0	39	RH now limiting to 2 shares max of GME.
l7zgdk	1	51	This is the same shit as yesterday, just disguised.
l7z0u9	0	24	The GME shorts' endgame.
l7z0u9	1	26	INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
l7z0u9	2	6	READ .
l7z0u9	3	31	Credit to u Pcbuildingnoob699 .
l7z0u9	4	150	I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information education and not financial advice.THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
l7z0u9	5	28	When might you want to sell?
l7z0u9	6	48	A quick guide for GME noobs.TL DR DIAMOND HAND .
l7z0u9	7	43	Too much disinformation about when to sell.
l7z0u9	8	224	We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending.
l7z0u9	9	79	Note I u TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time.
l7z0u9	10	164	I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years .
l7z0u9	11	71	"First, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" ."
l7z0u9	12	21	Official definition .
l7z0u9	13	139	Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
l7z0u9	14	166	Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.
l7z0u9	15	72	A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.
l7z0u9	16	21	Dumbed down version .
l7z0u9	17	72	imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass.
l7z0u9	18	62	How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass?
l7z0u9	19	116	If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass.
l7z0u9	20	47	If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
l7z0u9	21	41	Same thing with covering short positions.
l7z0u9	22	87	How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions?
l7z0u9	23	138	"You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"."
l7z0u9	24	109	Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.
l7z0u9	25	7	6 days.
l7z0u9	26	9	6.3 days.
l7z0u9	27	10	5.78 days.
l7z0u9	28	177	So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.
l7z0u9	29	31	So what does that mean for us?.
l7z0u9	30	88	Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position.
l7z0u9	31	17	When is that day?
l7z0u9	32	18	VERY FUCKING SOON.
l7z0u9	33	231	They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM in the money calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.
l7z0u9	34	82	Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to START covering.
l7z0u9	35	105	Now, IF this happens, then it's NOT gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS.
l7z0u9	36	176	Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!
l7z0u9	37	104	So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday.
l7z0u9	38	22	No need to panic sell.
l7z0u9	39	52	No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes.
l7z0u9	40	27	It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!.
l7z0u9	41	169	Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it.
l7z0u9	42	24	It takes DAYS to do so!.
l7z0u9	43	61	The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio.
l7z0u9	44	52	If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun.
l7z0u9	45	76	If it's still at fucking 138 140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.
l7z0u9	46	82	We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet!

l833dg	3	170	, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term .
l833dg	4	16	Very Long Post .
l833dg	5	15	Hello everyone!
l833dg	6	413	Let's start by talking a little about AMD they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like gaming consoles & PCs while also offering products for professional use like data centers.
l833dg	7	178	The company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.
l833dg	8	77	So, guys, let's go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for AMD.
l833dg	9	265	The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings share for the year.
l833dg	10	273	The company has 2 major income segments in Computing & Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income.
l833dg	11	236	They also provide an additional segment that doesn't bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can't be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock based compensations and acquisitions related costs.
l833dg	12	184	Both of these 2 segments have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing & graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.
l833dg	13	217	AMD didn't have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also adjusted their income with $312M in depreciation & amortizations.
l833dg	14	111	Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.
l833dg	15	147	They have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT stood at $1.37B.
l833dg	16	330	The company has seen a continued earnings per share growth overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced revenues in Q1 & Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.
l833dg	17	174	Their product portfolio has become a great challenge to Intel's market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.
l833dg	18	139	AMD announced the world's best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021..
l833dg	19	235	They have also launched the fastest AMD gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings & Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.
l833dg	20	168	AMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future.
l833dg	21	125	The one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx .
l833dg	22	145	, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues.
l833dg	23	100	Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies.
l833dg	24	166	They are targeting an all stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx.
l833dg	25	71	The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures.
l833dg	26	228	We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it's expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.
l833dg	27	293	AMD also offered great guidance for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product portfolio to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.
l833dg	28	146	I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations.
l833dg	29	153	So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on .
l833dg	30	127	So, let's start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow projections to see what the current valuation of the company is.
l833dg	31	230	I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.
l833dg	32	251	For the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10% year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.
l833dg	33	126	So, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025..
l833dg	34	226	Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets.
l833dg	35	176	I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.
l833dg	36	256	If we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company.
l833dg	37	152	But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.
l833dg	38	111	And now let's move on to a longer term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.
l833dg	39	123	For my projections I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.
l833dg	40	297	I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing & Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025..
l833dg	41	301	I think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage & digital currency mining.
l833dg	42	263	For their cost of sales I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing & Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement.
l833dg	43	132	I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in line with the previous years.
l833dg	44	124	This means for 2025 we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B.
l833dg	45	189	I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also substracted the interest & other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.
l833dg	46	142	I maintained their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.
l833dg	47	195	So, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings share, meaning the stock is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025..
l833dg	48	214	I like to base my future projections on Forward PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.
l833dg	49	56	So, after all these estimates what are my price targets?
l833dg	50	33	HERE are my actual price targets.
l833dg	51	257	I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$ share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price.
l833dg	52	103	But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%.
l833dg	53	239	So yeah guys, THIS are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE's with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35
l833dg	54	5	40. .
l833dg	55	248	So HERE is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.
l833dg	56	196	I think these are pretty reasonable targets as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more & more chips that also keep advancing in technology.
l833dg	57	156	The company also has very good financials with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.
l833dg	58	262	And let's also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in line with what other experts anticipate.
l833dg	59	75	So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?.
l833dg	60	167	Let's look at this CHART the stock just broke below the long term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86 87 levels, which is where the next support should stand.
l833dg	61	260	We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it's very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time.
l833dg	62	115	Intel will need some years & a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.
l833dg	63	254	AMD hasn't been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short squeezes.
l833dg	64	171	AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it's a psychological resistance rather.
l833dg	65	74	And let's take a quick look at what 24 analysts on Wall Street are saying.
l833dg	66	112	They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135.
l833dg	67	167	So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it's always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.
l833dg	68	20	So, what would I do?
l833dg	69	216	Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.
l833dg	70	246	One last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell off possibilities.
l833dg	71	331	So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel's performance.

l8r55y	6	209	When WSB became the base of all talks for stock trading, people realised that as a group, they could all give each advice on what stocks would provide best gains over long term due to their product being good.
l8r55y	7	220	Now that once dying Gamestop has been risen from the dead,as well as $AMC, people are waking up to the fact that we can control the market just as well as the Wall street guys, if not better, simply because of our voice.
l8r55y	8	156	That's why they are crying for regulation, and inspections on the forum as well as getting it deleted, because they realise that the game has been switched.

l84zbp	0	51	Number of GME 1 29 Calls that expired in the money.
l84zbp	1	65	Can someone please check my math understanding on the following?.
l84zbp	2	123	"I took the call graph from this link threw it in excel, added up the total \"open interest\" column and multiplied it by 100."
l84zbp	3	80	It came to the following call options for 9.2 million shares expired ITM today .
l84zbp	4	24	That's 20% of the float.
l84zbp	5	83	I'm a noob so I'm not sure how many of these will be cash settled or share settled.
l84zbp	6	138	But if even 20% of these are share settled, then that's 1.84m shares that need to be provided to individuals whose options were exercised.
l84zbp	7	148	This is likely very good for us as it will increase buying pressure by MM's, decrease share liquidity and makes it harder for the shorters to cover.
l84zbp	8	150	However there is also a potential down side as many of those call options could have been purchased by the shorters during their short ladder attacks.
l84zbp	9	134	This would allow them to generate gains on the way back up so they can continue to fund their short position and manipulation tactics.
l84zbp	10	82	Please let me know if any of you OG's can help clear up any of my misconceptions?.
l84zbp	11	40	Edit Thank you for clearing up my error!
l84zbp	12	97	I multiplied the open interest by 1000 the first time 9.2 million shares is MUCH more reasonable.

l8ohql	2	65	I've made a shit load of money because of the advice in this sub.
l8ohql	3	65	I've lost a shit load of money because of the advice in this sub.
l8ohql	4	74	"lol I see a few other subs I follow trying to mimic the \"culture\" wsb had."
l8ohql	5	109	The comments were just as volatile as the market and you had to have a set of balls to participate in either.
l8ohql	6	251	I fully encourage the new investor mindset that is currently saturating social media, but this sub has gained millions of new followers in days and they don't know how to satisfy my kink for being bullied after losing on all of my plays for the month.
l8ohql	7	287	I remember building my portfolio up and going all in at the beginning of the pandemic on some inovio calls, I lost 90% of all my hard work and wanted to shoot my dick off, sadly I spent all my money on calls and couldn't afford a gun so I settled for the self harm revolving door of wsb.
l8ohql	8	264	I feel like me and a bunch of my nerdy friends had a party, and people actually started to show up but we were already fucked up when they got to the party and now we're separated and I just want to find my way back to my friends but still enjoy the party ya know?
l8ohql	9	67	For all the pre gme and Tesla homies, the times they are a changin.
l8ohql	10	58	enjoy the weekend and look at the filthy mess you've made.
l8ohql	11	20	You dirty bastards .
l8ogrm	0	50	Explanation given for why trades being restricted.
l8ogrm	1	156	Watched Rossman's video yesterday that included the Webull CEO explaining the mechanics of how the trades work and WHY trade restrictions started happening.
l8ogrm	2	17	Very interesting.
l8ogrm	3	132	Being a total newb though, VERY curious like Louis to hear what those far more knowledgeable have to say about Denier's explanation.
l8ogrm	4	11	Hold water?
l8mf60	0	43	Just remember what's going on this weekend.
l8mf60	1	130	Remember what's going on while you're kicking back drinking a cold one, and fantasizing about bleeding these hedge funds to death.
l8mf60	2	131	Yes, while your wife and her boyfriend plan on what they're going to do with your portion of the wealth redistribution that is GME.
l8mf60	3	169	While you're laughing with your wife's boyfriend at all the memes, and generally having a good relaxing weekend, while realizing that Monday's don't seem so bad anymore.
l8mf60	4	41	These hedge fund bastards aren't resting.
l8mf60	5	26	They're fucking panicking.
l8mf60	6	79	They aren't sleeping well, and any drinks they have are to steady their nerves.
l8mf60	7	201	They're talking to their lawyers, their wives are looking for boyfriends, and the constant reminder that they're still over 100% short looms over their heads like a guillotine in the French Revolution.
l8mf60	8	127	We're coming, and while we enjoy life the way it always has been for us they are worried they may have to live less like kings.
l8mf60	9	73	They're worried about losing their money, and some of them their freedom.
l8mf60	10	114	They are calling, planning, plotting, trying to find a way to avoid holding the bags after this shit goes nuclear.
l8mf60	11	55	But the bottom line is they fucked up, and we found it.
l8mf60	12	80	We've already changed the way the finance game works for these hedge fund fucks.
l8mf60	13	150	We know now that some brokers are using us and our info to give these fucks yet another advantage over us, and we've exposed how frail this system is.
l8mf60	14	121	Not just because it's poorly built, but because regulations aren't actually sound and when they are they aren't enforced.
l8mf60	15	19	Enjoy your weekend.
l8mf60	16	89	You've earned it after the roller coaster that was GME, and any of the other meme stocks.
l8mf60	17	73	Just know that even after this thing goes parabolic the fight isn't over.
l8mf60	18	16	They will fight.
l8mf60	19	45	"They will try to \"protect\" you from yourself."
l8mf60	20	21	We must not let them.
l8mf60	21	44	We must use our winnings to stand and shout.
l8mf60	22	187	We must use the internet, which these dumbasses don't actually understand, to amplify our voices and be heard globally as we scream that we won't settle for less than a truly Free Market.
l8mf60	23	145	A market where I can yolo my Wendy's paycheck in hopes to buy my wife a new car so that maybe she will have sex with me instead of her boyfriend.
l8mf60	24	33	A market where stonks only go up.
l8mf60	25	155	A market where the autist isn't fucked by gay bears but instead grabs two fistfuls of fur and gives that gay bear the best dicking he's ever gotten before.
l8mf60	26	78	Be prepared to rrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeee like you've never rrrrrreeeeeeeee'd before.
l8mf60	27	82	If it comes to it we will have to ensure our ability to participate in the market.

l8glcl	1	8	Preface.
l8glcl	2	15	Holding $250k .
l8glcl	3	4	GME.
l8glcl	4	67	proof I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post.
l8glcl	5	76	Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll baiting title.
l8glcl	6	81	Now that I've won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on .
l8glcl	7	4	GME.
l8glcl	8	96	, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months.
l8glcl	9	5	TLDR.
l8glcl	10	6	Hold .
l8glcl	11	4	GME.
l8glcl	12	22	until Citadel is dead.
l8glcl	13	41	Puts on anything a few months after that.
l8glcl	14	57	Wall street will win in the end but I'll come out on top.
l8glcl	15	19	Where we are today.
l8glcl	16	73	It's not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions.
l8glcl	17	111	We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom.
l8glcl	18	53	Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%.
l8glcl	19	71	I don't think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market.
l8glcl	20	29	"\"Okay, so what will happen?\"."
l8glcl	21	15	Good question!.
l8glcl	22	17	What will happen.
l8glcl	23	22	Short Term 1 4 weeks .
l8glcl	24	6	This .
l8glcl	25	4	GME.
l8glcl	26	60	short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon.
l8glcl	27	55	Once the short sellers get margin called the price of .
l8glcl	28	4	GME.
l8glcl	29	49	is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels.
l8glcl	30	83	I'm holding till $69,420 Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker.
l8glcl	31	43	Who knows, maybe a too bank if we're lucky.
l8glcl	32	78	The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.
l8glcl	33	53	At $10,000 share the market cap is only $700 billion.
l8glcl	34	67	This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
l8glcl	35	7	Maybe .
l8glcl	36	4	GME.
l8glcl	37	74	is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks.
l8glcl	38	93	I don't know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in a row.
l8glcl	39	10	Once the .
l8glcl	40	4	GME.
l8glcl	41	45	squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.
l8glcl	42	21	Mid Term 1 3 months .
l8glcl	43	16	In the case of .
l8glcl	44	4	GME.
l8glcl	45	32	retail won and hedge funds lost.
l8glcl	46	174	Wall Street doesn't like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.
l8glcl	47	153	For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens.
l8glcl	48	72	We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%.
l8glcl	49	119	The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze.
l8glcl	50	90	While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price.
l8glcl	51	23	Since retail won with .
l8glcl	52	4	GME.
l8glcl	53	171	, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are.
l8glcl	54	99	It's going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever.
l8glcl	55	86	A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again.
l8glcl	56	23	A squebble if you will.
l8glcl	57	133	Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts.
l8glcl	58	125	We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining.
l8glcl	59	43	This brings us to the third and final term.
l8glcl	60	13	Long term 4 .
l8glcl	61	10	8 months .
l8glcl	62	18	Okay quick recap .
l8glcl	63	18	We're in a bubble.
l8glcl	64	31	hedge funds are closing shorts.
l8glcl	65	31	retail is buying up everything.
l8glcl	66	61	This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme.
l8glcl	67	121	Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them.
l8glcl	68	81	Hedge funds or brokers won't allow this type of overeverage from happening again.
l8glcl	69	182	Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value.
l8glcl	70	85	Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments.
l8glcl	71	55	Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don't know.
l8glcl	72	125	I'm just a 25 year old engineer who doesn't really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market.
l8glcl	73	9	End game.
l8glcl	74	11	Still here?
l8glcl	75	6	Great!
l8glcl	76	54	Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel.
l8glcl	77	84	Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market.
l8glcl	78	110	Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun.
l8glcl	79	120	Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion It literally can't go up forever, sorry bulls .
l8glcl	80	104	We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button.
l8glcl	81	87	In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued.
l8glcl	82	44	This is when everything comes tumbling down.
l8glcl	83	103	It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first.
l8glcl	84	42	Then it will cascade into everything else.
l8glcl	85	70	We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before.
l8glcl	86	139	This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again.
l8glcl	87	10	Positions.
l8glcl	88	20	1. Short term 100% .
l8glcl	89	4	GME.
l8glcl	90	5	baby!
l8glcl	91	7	proof .
l8glcl	92	25	2. Mid term Cash I guess?
l8glcl	93	36	I'll probably lose everything here .
l8glcl	94	28	3. Long term 9 16 TSLA $400p
l8fz38	0	137	What's happening is great, but don't let the media's narrative draw attention away from the Wall Street greed that ACTUALLY started this.
l8fz38	1	62	TL DR at the end for the retards who didn't pass third grade .
l8fz38	2	334	"So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk tolerant self proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and \"screw the hedge funds\" because we were \"bored at home\" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else."
l8fz38	3	61	Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story.
l8fz38	4	114	After all we hype around shit all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?.
l8fz38	5	140	This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.
l8fz38	6	180	If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation.
l8fz38	7	49	But in case you're new that's not what happened .
l8fz38	8	235	This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces.
l8fz38	9	163	They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.
l8fz38	10	123	"Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock for good reason , not to collectively just \"fuck the shorts\"."
l8fz38	11	103	Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc.
l8fz38	12	23	You guys know the deal.
l8fz38	13	85	This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord & Savior DVT.
l8fz38	14	86	Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike.
l8fz38	15	64	The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral.
l8fz38	16	39	And yes, other firms are buying in too.
l8fz38	17	122	"No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one \"holding the line\"."
l8fz38	18	131	Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that still leaves institutional investors with 70% of shares.
l8fz38	19	110	Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.
l8fz38	20	115	Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares & options to the fucking andromeda galaxy.
l8fz38	21	85	But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context.
l8fz38	22	113	It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.
l8fz38	23	124	TL DR WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.
l8fz38	24	18	WE LIKE THE STOCK.
l8eate	0	46	We're all in a REALLY GOOD SPOT with Gamestop.
l8eate	1	118	Here's what I've been seeing these last couple of days that gives me a LOT of hope that the squeeze on GME is working.
l8eate	2	134	Aside from media and billionaires freaking out, which gives me confidence that this is real, let's take a look at some other examples.
l8eate	3	76	At the beginning of this week, we were looking at volumes close to 150 200M.
l8eate	4	151	That volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases, but even today, the trading volume was relatively low.
l8eate	5	129	Additionally, the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares BOUGHT than sold.
l8eate	6	105	The price is around $315 and most people STILL aren't selling, indicated by the low volume today Friday .
l8eate	7	130	That means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it.
l8eate	8	120	This has become a movement though, and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street.
l8eate	9	49	You think fewer people are going to get involved.
l8eate	10	8	hell no!
l8eate	11	117	More people want in on this, with those from Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and across the world getting in on this.
l8eate	12	152	If people keep buying more shares and holding, there will be fewer shares available for trading and we'll likely see even less volume in the days ahead.
l8eate	13	28	How do we know they'll hold.
l8eate	14	129	well most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they don't mind losing some money if it comes to it.
l8eate	15	44	Most importantly, this means THEY WILL HOLD!
l8eate	16	132	Plus, a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable, neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds.
l8eate	17	43	This does NOT end well for them in any way.
l8eate	18	210	The squeeze may not happen immediately, but as the number of available shares decreases, the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover.
l8eate	19	82	In fact, the longer this goes on, the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point.
l8eate	20	118	They're still short 100% and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and HOLD.
l8eate	21	33	Its really only a matter of time.
l8eate	22	18	so keep the faith!
l8e4t2	0	24	Are we holding the bags?
l8dqx7	0	72	Friendly PSA Move your money off Robbinghood to any of these brokerages.

l8amyk	0	73	Why You Should Rethink Using Fintech Apps Like Robinhood To Trade Stocks.
l8amyk	1	13	Hello there,.
l8amyk	2	72	it was a crazy week for most of us due to GME and other volatile stocks.
l8amyk	3	102	Companies standing behind trading apps like Robinhood have imposed restrictions on trading GME stocks.
l8amyk	4	35	Where to trade if not on Robinhood?
l8amyk	5	69	Look for trading accounts via banks like brokerage checking accounts.
l8amyk	6	123	Banks charge fees but you are going to be sure you won't get fucked by them just like by Robinhood or Trading 212 fintechs.
l8amyk	7	135	If you're using trading apps to invest in stocks at least read terms of services so you would know what to expect if shit hits the fan.
l8amyk	8	77	Some brokers have their headquarters in financial havens like Cayman Islands.
l8amyk	9	18	Did you know that?
l8amyk	10	26	That is why I chose banks.
l8amyk	11	50	There is a lot of pros for using banks to invest .
l8amyk	12	113	When you make an order through bank you have certainity that your order will be executed instantly on the market.
l8amyk	13	55	Banks don't sell data about your trades to hedge funds.
l8amyk	14	140	There is no conflict of interest beetwen you as an investor and your bank becouse it charges fee, so the more you make the more bank makes .
l8amyk	15	5	win .
l8amyk	16	92	win situation they have no interest to fuck you, they want you to make more and more money .
l8amyk	17	88	Banks can provide a lot of analytic tools and real, fast support in case of some issues.
l8amyk	18	206	I hope you are going to rethink using frauded brokers like Robinhood or Trading 212, they don't play fair, they fuck us so why shouldn't we fuck them by denying to use them and destroying their reputation?.
l8amyk	19	53	I wish y'all calm weekend and huge profits next week!

l890wz	1	49	This is the most important DD you will ever read.
l890wz	2	186	I don't usually post here but this needs to be spread.If we can band together and understand how the silver markets are leveraged $SLV and other silver stocks could go absolutely flying.
l890wz	3	67	Silver is the most manipulated and corrupted market in Wall Street.
l890wz	4	209	Big hedges have been suppressing the price for years to hide inflation from there corrupt friends at the FED and ultimately have leveraged hundreds of times more paper silver than actually silver in existence.
l890wz	5	67	Silver is in more demand then ever and the supply will only shrink.
l890wz	6	63	In silver highs the price in today's money would be 600$ 1000$.
l890wz	7	74	And now it floats at 25$ when the highs in the 80s where in the 50$ range.
l890wz	8	389	It is so absurd and if we can all recognize this we truly could take down the entire establishment starting from the hedges down all the way to our corrupted federal reserve that has literally printed most of the money supply in the past year, which in theory should send silver flying to the moon but is being suppressed by the crooks on Wall Street to hide inflation and make you poorer.
l890wz	9	8	TL DR. .
l890wz	10	66	BUY SILVER TAKE DOWN THE ESTABLISHMENT, something we all agree on.
l890wz	11	83	$SLV should literally be in the high hundreds if not thousands if we can all unite.

l88gix	0	34	Hey fellow autist, check this out.
l88gix	1	39	TLDR Whales had too much for a century.
l88gix	2	59	This may be only chance for little guys to overcome whales.
l88gix	3	28	Stock Market In Its Default.
l88gix	4	73	For the past centuries of stock trading, riches had most power on stocks.
l88gix	5	142	The idea that a stock can be traded on an expectation basis is a scam where big whales can bait little fish's money and start devouring on it.
l88gix	6	61	You may disagree with me but first let's consider an example.
l88gix	7	36	A company makes $100 profit an year.
l88gix	8	39	The company IPOs with $1000 market cap.
l88gix	9	52	Whales hold 40% of the shares as initial bagholders.
l88gix	10	39	Case 1 nobody wants to trade the stock.
l88gix	11	91	If nobody traded any stock, the stock will sit sideways and no one will gain or lose money.
l88gix	12	39	i.e. rich will not gain nor lose money.
l88gix	13	60	Case 2 the company is popular and people look to buy at IPO.
l88gix	14	131	Obviously in this case, stock prices will increase with little guy's $110, $120 bid until riches start selling their stock at $200.
l88gix	15	164	If the stock gets sold back to $100, all of the little guys lost money while whales gained profit even when the stock price our baseline case has remained the same.
l88gix	16	72	Case 3 the company is performing poorly, and less people want the stock.
l88gix	17	55	In this case, rich people will sell for $100, $90, $80.
l88gix	18	72	and only little guys will buy in the stocks with decreasing stock price.
l88gix	19	158	The rich people who initially bought the stock in at $50 or less has still come out of profit while little guys lose money due to the decreasing stock prices.
l88gix	20	55	See how whales as initial bagholders always win money!.
l88gix	21	28	Wait, this is too much math!
l88gix	22	15	I don't get it!
l88gix	23	12	Don't worry.
l88gix	24	27	I'll give a simple summary.
l88gix	25	71	Whales can initially invest in a company for a way lower price than us.
l88gix	26	97	Once the company IPOs they build up their wealth over little guy's money flooding into the stock.
l88gix	27	126	Notice that stock market is ultimately a zero sum game, and odds are in favor of whales who had early invested in the company.
l88gix	28	110	Some may argue the above is false given that more people tend to hold the stock over time with an expectation.
l88gix	29	33	Now, here is what is interesting.
l88gix	30	70	Let's consider a company which doesn't hold any debt or any liquidity.
l88gix	31	35	The company is 50% owned by whales.
l88gix	32	43	The company IPOs at $100 a share at 20 PE .
l88gix	33	44	Notice that company holds no money nor debt.
l88gix	34	43	In reality, the company should be valued at
l88gix	35	128	"0. But whales who are the initial bagholders of this game can sell their 50% ownership at $100 a share due to the \"expectation\"."
l88gix	36	72	This is the magic of turning $0 worth company into $100 a share company.
l88gix	37	52	But what if the company will worth more in 10 years?
l88gix	38	123	Then, whales who held onto the stock will be able to sell the stocks at 20PE after 10 years whether it be $1000 or $10000 .
l88gix	39	25	Do you see the game here?
l88gix	40	49	The initial bagholders always come out of profit.
l88gix	41	84	They are the BANK of this system and will build up the wealth using the little guys.
l88gix	42	117	Moreover, the big guys tend to trade on a premature company information which gives them an advantage of early moves.
l88gix	43	17	But, is this bad?
l88gix	44	3	NO.
l88gix	45	21	It's not a bad thing.
l88gix	46	30	It's just how market is built.
l88gix	47	118	Just remember, in an ordinary market, little guys will tend to lose money because the market is ultimately a zero sum.
l88gix	48	50	The initial investors will always come out better.
l88gix	49	14	GME, AMC, etc.
l88gix	50	5	Case.
l88gix	51	41	Now the story gets even more fascinating.
l88gix	52	64	"In these stocks cases, whales were not the \"initial bagholders\"."
l88gix	53	58	Instead, they held a short selling position of the stocks.
l88gix	54	75	"Retails came in and bought the stocks, and became the \"initial bagholders\"."
l88gix	55	66	Do you remember from the above that initial bagholders always win?
l88gix	56	59	This is the case where initial bagholders were the retails.
l88gix	57	84	Whales didn't have time to get in or had the priority of getting the pre IPO shares.
l88gix	58	77	Instead, their shorts will print money into the stocks as the move continues.
l88gix	59	167	"Due to the short selling restrictions, whales who hugely shorted these stocks \"MUST\" continue purchasing the stocks, which will increase the stock prices even further."
l88gix	60	40	We can apply this in a macroscopic view.
l88gix	61	197	If we think of GME as a market where one can invest and Citadel as a bank, then this is a case where the bank Citadel is always backing the GME market unlimited QE as long as preconditions are met.
l88gix	62	81	The precondition here is that share price has to be above the short strike price.
l88gix	63	82	Then, the market will only keep growing until the bank has no more money to print.
l88gix	64	128	"Retails who are now the early investors, or \"initial bagholders\", will be for a first time bagholders of a giantly large market."
l88gix	65	10	Scenarios.
l88gix	66	126	The best case is when retails continue buying holding onto the stocks until Citadel's unlimited QE finally ends in the market.
l88gix	67	93	As long as the preconditions continue to meet, there will be unlimited QE for the GME market.
l88gix	68	81	The worst case is when retails panic sell the stocks and the stocks go to bottom.
l88gix	69	101	This will allow Citadel to print money from their shorts, and it means that there is no unlimited QE.
l88gix	70	35	Only retails were hurt in the case.
l88gix	71	16	What I am doing.
l88gix	72	58	I am a retail myself and will obviously side with retails.
l88gix	73	132	I am also very angry especially at the stinky game going on behind the scenes of these trading platforms, and will not forgive them.
l88gix	74	33	I will continue HOLDing with my .
l88gix	75	15	until everyone.
l88gix	76	4	to .
l88gix	77	47	Disclaimer None of these are investment advice.
l88gix	78	21	Do your own research!
l87t40	0	108	What will happen with an influx of 10 million users flocked other brokerages over the next two weeks or so?.
l87t40	1	32	Robin Hood has 13 million users.
l87t40	2	116	Clearly it won't have 13 million for long, so we are going to have 5 10 million people flocking to other brokerages.
l87t40	3	372	"Someone way smarter than me, feel free to offer your insight, but it seems to me like the brokeragws that get flocked to are going to have the same \"concerns\" Robin Hood had about protecting the little guy and preventing volatility which is all just lies for actually wanting to protect big money market makers and start doling out restrictions the same way Robin Hood is."
l87t40	4	98	Cuz I mean that amount of people influx is going to have an effect on these firms risk management.
l87t40	5	89	I feel like they are going to slowly make restrictions on retail investing industry wide.
l87t40	6	50	Anyone with some thoughts to make me feel better?.
l87t40	7	92	Seriously, tell me I'm crazy and that it's never going to happen like this, and tell me why.
l87t40	8	118	Edit seriously, somebody make a long, well thought out response as to why I'm crazy and this is never going to happen.
l87t40	9	113	cuz I absolutely do not want it to happen but it really seems like that's where we're headed and it's terrifying.
l87t40	10	33	I mean look at this fucking list.
l87t40	11	39	There's over FIFTY stocks on here!!!!!!
l87t40	12	75	And fucking Boomer ones to like not just random obscure Reddit meme stocks.
l87t40	13	178	Go run through that whole thing yourself guys oh, we are being locked out of literally anything that has a catalyst of any kind or anything that has above average trading volume.
l87t40	14	72	It's really fucking terrifying there are big ass fucking names on there.
l87t40	15	48	Like why the fuck does GM need to be restricted?
l87t40	16	5	Sbux?
l87t40	17	160	"Again, someone please come in here and tell me \"it's just Robinhood, and no other brokerage would ever do this so massively in any event ever, and here is why\"."
l87t40	18	29	That is what I'm looking for.
l87t40	19	156	I know that other brokerages have in some cases been putting restrictions on buying, but it's genuinely been limited to like five or six pure Reddit stocks.
l87t40	20	174	But if all of the Robinhood users leave and go to other brokerages, is there a logical cogent argument as to why those other brokerages would never restrict THIS many stocks?
l87t40	21	34	And I mean totally unrelated ones.
l87t40	22	187	This is literally retail investors just being blocked from investing there's no other way to put that it's not just fucking troll shit there are again, fucking big ass names on that list.
l87t40	23	306	Second edit I mean that amount of users, 13 mil, even if it's split up into three or four different ways between three or four different brokerages that is going to add a massive amount of risk calculation to every brokerage that just gets fucking in fluxed with straight up millions of people at one time.
l87t40	24	35	You want to talk about volatility?.
l87t40	25	101	I mean again, is there a reason that no one is straight up expecting shit to go fucked up like this?.
l87t40	26	91	And that is not rhetorical, someone please give me a reason so I can stop worrying about it

l85v6v	0	63	You should know there's other stock broker apps than Robinhood.
l85v6v	1	172	I know a lot of people here already know this, but WSB has grown massively, thanks to the media trying to nuke it, so I feel there's probably a lot of people here to learn.
l85v6v	2	172	So, the first thing you need to know before you get started trading investing is that not only are there other trading apps out there, but robinhood is genuinely the worst.
l85v6v	3	107	I'm not just saying this because of what's going on with them these past couple days, robinhood just sucks.
l85v6v	4	57	Robinhood doesn't let you trade OTC stocks penny stocks .
l85v6v	5	27	Robinhood has shitty hours.
l85v6v	6	74	Robinhood has had server problems at the worst times they could have them.
l85v6v	7	77	Robinhood is pulling this shit with limiting stocks, and mommying it's users.
l85v6v	8	39	Robinhood customer service is terrible.
l85v6v	9	166	You can ask for opinions on other apps here, most people use either TD Ameritrade, Webul, Fidelity, or Schwab, and honestly none of them check all the boxes I'd like.
l85v6v	10	92	but one thing everyone agrees on is that Robinhood is legitimately the worst of all of them.
l85v6v	11	61	Robinhood looks nice, but the others are just as easy to use.
l85v6v	12	52	If you're looking for a broker, don't use Robinhood.
l85v6v	13	106	If you're currently using Robinhood, you should start the switch to another broker immediately, right now.
l85v6v	14	78	It's really easy to leave robinhood and transfer your money to another broker.
l85v6v	15	56	It takes minutes on your end, then they handle the rest.
l85v6v	16	73	Answer a couple questions, hit send, and the two brokers handle the rest.
l85v6v	17	9	Godspeed.
l85v6v	18	6	Edit .
l85v6v	19	67	You can transfer as much or as little out of robinhood as you want.
l85v6v	20	62	You don't have to close robinhood out to start somewhere else.
l85v6v	21	169	So, for example, if you wanted leave Robinhood, but you don't want to sell certain stocks you own yet, but you want to transfer any cash you have in it, you can do that.

l858fh	1	66	First of all, everyone please go check out your broker's over at .
l858fh	2	52	A small snippet from Robinhood's disclosure states .
l858fh	3	103	"\"ONE OF THE FIRM'S PRIMARY SELLING POINTS WAS THAT IT DID NOT CHARGE ITS CUSTOMERS TRADING COMMISSIONS."
l858fh	4	204	"IN REALITY, HOWEVER, \"COMMISSION FREE\" TRADING AT THE FIRM CAME WITH A CATCH THE FIRM'S CUSTOMERS RECEIVED INFERIOR EXECUTION PRICES COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE FIRM'S COMPETITIORS."
l858fh	5	117	FOR LARGER VALUE ORDERS,THIS PRICE DIFFERENCE AT THE FIRM EXCEEDED THE COMMISSION ITS COMPETITORS WOULD HAVE CHARGED.
l858fh	6	180	THESE INFERIOR PRICES WERE CAUSED IN LARGE PART BY THE UNUSUALLY HIGH AMOUNTS THE FIRM CHARGED PRINCIPAL TRADING FIRMS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER ORDER FLOW.
l858fh	7	160	"THESE PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS \"PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW.\" CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S RETAIL COMMUNICATIONS OMITTED ITS RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW."
l858fh	8	94	SINCE THE FIRM'S LAUNCH, PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW HAS BEEN THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE.
l858fh	9	410	"THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS AND TRADE CONFIRMATIONS STATED IT \"MAY\" RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW, HOWEVER, IN FAQS ON THE FIRM'S WEBSITE DESCRIBING HOW IT MADE MONEY, AND IN CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS ADDRESSING THE SAME ISSUE, IT OMITTED PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW WHEN IT DESCRIBED ITS REVENUE SOURCES BECAUSE IT BELIEVED THAT PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW MIGHT BE VIEWED AS CONTROVERSIAL BY CUSTOMERS."
l858fh	10	156	THE FIRM ALSO INSTRUCTED ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES NOT TO MENTION PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SOURCES OF REVENUE.
l858fh	11	154	TLDR Robinhood fills your orders at shittier prices, that results in additional costs that exceed the cost of commission you would pay at competing firms.
l858fh	12	117	Robinhood also lied and was purposefully deceptive about selling YOUR ORDER INFO to principal trading firms CITADEL .

l8oz1b	1	35	Holding though ER, any suggestions?
l8or4p	0	21	The Robinhood Fiasco.
l8or4p	1	90	Full disclosure I have $ in Robinhood right now and am stuck with them for the time being.
l8or4p	2	103	Who would've thought that my joke YOLO of $5k would turn into $200k and I'd be worried about my money?.
l8or4p	3	51	And before anyone calls me a shill fuck those guys.
l8or4p	4	67	If they're not colluding with hedge funds, they look shady as shit.
l8or4p	5	152	Restricting stock, changing their policies to force sales of options BEFORE the 3 00pm EST cutoff time, and selling at the absolute worst time possible?
l8or4p	6	51	Yeah they're gonna face some serious repercussions.
l8or4p	7	41	The SEC, FINRA, NYSE, DOJ, FBI, Congress.
l8or4p	8	48	they're all gonna look into what these guys did.
l8or4p	9	107	If they find a shred of evidence of wrongdoing against old Vlad there, the dude is going to federal prison.
l8or4p	10	49	Mark my words he will absolutely be the fall guy.
l8or4p	11	27	And forget about their IPO.
l8or4p	12	21	That company is done.
l8or4p	13	9	Fuck 'em.
l8or4p	14	101	I've already filed complaints with the SEC, FINRA, and NYSE, and I encourage everyone to do the same.
l8or4p	15	93	Restricting stock trading was probably their biggest mistake, and I hope they go down for it.
l8or4p	16	79	Ok now that that's out of the way, here's what I think is going on over there .
l8or4p	17	42	Half of all Robinhood users own GME stock.
l8or4p	18	31	That's a fucking absurd number.
l8or4p	19	75	And we're buying the shit out of it at volumes no one has ever seen before.
l8or4p	20	72	On top of that, we managed to get Robinhood's app to 1 in the App store.
l8or4p	21	49	Not for investing or finance, but for EVERYTHING.
l8or4p	22	65	That's an internet hug of death that would've overwhelmed anyone.
l8or4p	23	42	And everyone who downloaded it bought GME.
l8or4p	24	135	On top of that, despite our motto of buy and HOLD , there are some guys who are swing trading this shit every time it spikes and tanks.
l8or4p	25	64	Stupid and I hope we leave them in the dust, but it's happening.
l8or4p	26	89	So let's say, on an average day, Robinhood does 10 million trades no idea, making it up .
l8or4p	27	75	On Wednesday, they did 100 million trades example and freaked the fuck out.
l8or4p	28	116	When we buy sell a stock, it looks like it's instant, but some stuff goes on behind the scenes that we'll never see.
l8or4p	29	94	Basically, at the end of the day, all of the brokers come to the bar and settle up their tabs.
l8or4p	30	42	And they can't use our money to do it for.
l8or4p	31	8	reasons.
l8or4p	32	56	So they have to have the $ available to pay their bills.
l8or4p	33	55	These are the clearing houses you may have heard about.
l8or4p	34	40	And we just absolutely overwhelmed them.
l8or4p	35	101	They were prepared for maybe up to 100 million trades overall, but not 100 million on a single stock.
l8or4p	36	73	And not when we're also buying the shit out of AMC, BB, BBBY, and others.
l8or4p	37	20	So what did they do?
l8or4p	38	14	They panicked.
l8or4p	39	100	They restricted buying of those stocks in order to be able to pay their tabs on Thursday and Friday.
l8or4p	40	67	They also went out and raised $1 billion from investors good move .
l8or4p	41	66	But what they DIDN'T do was explain wtf was going on to investors.
l8or4p	42	67	They simply said this was for our protection and due to volatility.
l8or4p	43	8	This is.
l8or4p	44	14	actually true.
l8or4p	45	8	Sort of.
l8or4p	46	27	They have to pay their tab.
l8or4p	47	70	If they can't do it, we can't buy sell at all and they could go under.
l8or4p	48	82	And this is all because of what we're doing, which is creating massive volatility.
l8or4p	49	143	They actually ran into a similar problem back in March last year when they raised $200 million because, again, we bought the shit out of stuff.
l8or4p	50	116	"The CEO should have come out and said, \"Look, we're having liquidity issues that have nothing to do with bankruptcy."
l8or4p	51	103	We're very profitable they are , you're just buying too much, too fast, and we weren't prepared for it.
l8or4p	52	37	So it was either this or we go under.
l8or4p	53	14	We chose this.
l8or4p	54	46	Except what would your average Redditor hear?.
l8or4p	55	22	OMG THEY'RE BANKRUPT!!
l8or4p	56	28	That would cause mass panic.
l8or4p	57	48	We'd actually probably fuck this whole thing up.
l8or4p	58	145	Everyone would sell their GME shares and try to rush out of Robinhood, the GME stock would tank, short sellers would win, and we'd lose the game.
l8or4p	59	31	And this wasn't just Robinhood.
l8or4p	60	80	E Trade, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Webull all had the same issues.
l8or4p	61	100	Webull wasn't as shitty about it and the CEO came out and explained, and then allowed trading again.
l8or4p	62	99	Over the weekend, Robinhood should come out and tell the people what's going on in a VERY calm way.
l8or4p	63	107	Then go to Chase and secure a $10 billion line of credit for the short squeeze and tell us you're doing it.
l8or4p	64	25	Stop restricting trading.
l8or4p	65	60	Apologize profusely and send us all $40 DoorDash gift cards.
l8or4p	66	131	If you have $ with Robinhood and it's not tied up in GME, do as others have suggested and switch to Fidelity, Vanguard, Chase, etc.
l8or4p	67	30	If you're stuck, you're stuck.
l8or4p	68	133	If the absolute worst case scenario happens and Robinhood somehow ends up bankrupt, we have SIPC protection like FDIC up to $500,000.
l8or4p	69	98	And the federal government will step in and liquidate them and try to get you your $ back as well.
l8or4p	70	108	In almost every single instance of a broker failing, people were able to get almost all of their money back.
l8or4p	71	35	So don't worry about that TOO much.
l8or4p	72	114	In the end, yes, Robinhood deserves a shit ton of blame for all of this and I hope they go bankrupt when they IPO.
l8or4p	73	137	I think it's extremely suspicious that they have a relationship with the guys we're up against, and their actions don't look good at all.
l8or4p	74	128	I hope we just overwhelmed them, and the coming week will probably give us more insight into whether they're innocent or guilty.
l8or4p	75	42	So again fuck Robinhood for what they did.
l8or4p	76	94	They can try to turn things around and be more transparent so we can at least trade this week.
l8or4p	77	101	It benefits all of us to hope they succeed, because that's where most of the GME buying is happening.
l8or4p	78	54	EDIT So why not transfer my money or shares elsewhere?
l8or4p	79	82	Because it takes too long and we have no idea when this thing is gonna go nuclear.
l8or4p	80	96	If I felt like I had time, believe me, these shares would be on their way to Fidelity right now.
l8or4p	81	109	But if we hit $1,000 or $10,000 share in the next few days and my shares are locked, I won't be able to sell.
l8or4p	82	79	They'd probably clear right around the time this thing came back down to earth.
l8or4p	83	16	I'd want to die.
l8ohmy	0	12	Hear me out.

l8o6yo	1	12	Story here .
l8o6yo	2	223	I'll write a longer post about why this is wrong, how the financial media's bias and spin is getting more obvious, and talk about what I'm hearing from the HF world later, but let me just say now this is comical horse shit.
l8o6yo	3	35	The hedge funds are not doing well.
l8o6yo	4	45	Steve Cohen rage quit Twitter for fucks sake.

l8nap0	0	80	Thursday morning the entire market was on the brink of another financial crisis.
l8nap0	1	89	For many of you reading this you may not understand what truly happened Thursday morning.
l8nap0	2	46	We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment.
l8nap0	3	133	Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.
l8nap0	4	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	5	131	"TLDR Had the \"FREE MARKET\" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds."
l8nap0	6	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	7	24	Understanding Leverage .
l8nap0	8	96	Many people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market.
l8nap0	9	205	These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM Assets under management they are likely leveraged up 5 10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60 120 Billion.
l8nap0	10	119	If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage.
l8nap0	11	69	This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.
l8nap0	12	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	13	39	The entire market was at systemic risk.
l8nap0	14	41	They had no out so they changed the game.
l8nap0	15	120	"The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every \"meme\" stock."
l8nap0	16	255	Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.
l8nap0	17	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	18	43	Changing collateral requirements suddenly .
l8nap0	19	109	Well guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to 100% .
l8nap0	20	56	This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock.
l8nap0	21	47	This is the true culprit behind whats going on.
l8nap0	22	122	The Citadel was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses.
l8nap0	23	67	This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15 20%.
l8nap0	24	31	They COULD NOT let this happen.
l8nap0	25	96	You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?.
l8nap0	26	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	27	42	A coordinated attack on retail investors .
l8nap0	28	85	I have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday.
l8nap0	29	173	These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position.
l8nap0	30	88	Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages.
l8nap0	31	135	Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core.
l8nap0	32	68	You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD.
l8nap0	33	96	This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.
l8nap0	34	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	35	64	Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup .
l8nap0	36	75	So what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.
l8nap0	37	10	$GME 1000.
l8nap0	38	3	$BB
l8nap0	39	5	50. .
l8nap0	40	4	$AMC
l8nap0	41	5	30. .
l8nap0	42	4	$NOK
l8nap0	43	5	12. .
l8nap0	44	7	&nbsp .
l8nap0	45	40	Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.
l8nap0	46	133	Just a man who has worked in and around the industry for over a decade with a lot of experience about what goes on behind the scenes.
l8mmp4	0	23	$GME Autistic Epiphany.
l8mmp4	1	64	I combined two posts on WSB in my head and something big hit me.
l8mmp4	2	82	This first post explains how you're not just buying $GME when you buy their stock.
l8mmp4	3	58	You're also buying a stake in all the hedgies shorting it.
l8mmp4	4	75	Then this second post explains how it's not just the hedgies shorting $GME.
l8mmp4	5	79	There's a big bank backing the hedgies like a too big to fail big bank TBTFBB .
l8mmp4	6	82	So all these CNBC boomers taking about $GME fUnDaMeNtAlS are just fucking with us.
l8mmp4	7	62	Here's what's probably the truth THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
l8mmp4	8	28	I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.
l8mmp4	9	13	AM RETARDED .
l8mmp4	10	141	Since more shares of $GME are sold short than actually exist 110 120% , we're getting a 10 20% discount on a TBTFBB, AND GameStop's business.
l8mmp4	11	85	This applies at ANY share price as long as the shorted shares exceed existing shares.
l8mmp4	12	124	This assumes there's a TBTFBB backing the hedgies, that the squeeze is successful, and that we sell when the squeeze occurs.
l8mmp4	13	70	In other words, our investment is backed by the fucking US Government.
l8mmp4	14	63	I'm short on sleep and hope I don't regret this when I wake up.
l8lrsd	0	44	GME Why I feel less optimistic after Friday.
l8lrsd	1	22	Please don't lynch me.
l8lrsd	2	48	No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause.
l8lrsd	3	169	I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic.
l8lrsd	4	83	Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't.
l8lrsd	5	88	Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't.
l8lrsd	6	86	Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening .
l8lrsd	7	13	does anybody?
l8lrsd	8	157	Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.
l8lrsd	9	92	1 Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday.
l8lrsd	10	72	It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.
l8lrsd	11	105	2 Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them.
l8lrsd	12	104	AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded after 40 million for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly.
l8lrsd	13	184	IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account .
l8lrsd	14	76	This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.
l8lrsd	15	168	3 Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point.
l8lrsd	16	69	If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze.
l8lrsd	17	174	And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering 1 .
l8lrsd	18	144	4 Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.
l8lrsd	19	79	5 A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market.
l8lrsd	20	46	Do you really believe this is going to happen?
l8lrsd	21	20	Don't be ridiculous.
l8lrsd	22	64	They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.
l8lrsd	23	42	6 There are two many players involved now.
l8lrsd	24	28	Before it was an easy story.
l8lrsd	25	76	One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them.
l8lrsd	26	166	Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore .
l8lrsd	27	153	You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in.
l8lrsd	28	173	What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation?
l8lrsd	29	94	To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore.
l8lrsd	30	32	Even if they go for the squeeze.
l8lrsd	31	103	What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag?
l8lrsd	32	76	They know the game 100 times better than any of you and will screw you over.
l8lrsd	33	64	7 We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged.
l8lrsd	34	15	Simple as that.
l8lrsd	35	89	Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows.
l8lrsd	36	39	We don't know if they actually covered.
l8lrsd	37	28	There's also dark pools btw.
l8lrsd	38	66	Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.
l8lrsd	39	35	I thought about this long and hard.
l8lrsd	40	36	Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.
l8lrsd	41	33	A People lose interest next week.
l8lrsd	42	44	The price will fall, people will panic sell.
l8lrsd	43	74	And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose.
l8lrsd	44	70	I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.
l8lrsd	45	102	B The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation.
l8lrsd	46	142	The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.
l8lrsd	47	328	C The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene.
l8lrsd	48	71	If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.
l8lrsd	49	68	D The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze.
l8lrsd	50	158	It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost.
l8lrsd	51	95	Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.
l8lrsd	52	74	E We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on.
l8lrsd	53	121	It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares.
l8lrsd	54	91	Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this.
l8lrsd	55	241	But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.
l8lrsd	56	19	Don't get me wrong.
l8lrsd	57	194	I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.
l8lrsd	58	115	I'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher.
l8lrsd	59	156	Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose because this is the most likely outcome and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.
l8lrsd	60	179	Edit After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good logical argument why after all this might work.
l8lrsd	61	49	None of you idiots pointed this out to me though.
l8lrsd	62	19	Good luck everyone.
l8lrsd	63	82	I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason.
l8lrsd	64	51	Thanks for all the thoughtful comments and insults.
l8lrsd	65	124	I also got added to the controversial club since apparently this thread was one of the most controversial in entire reddit .
l8l0xy	0	15	FUCK ROBINHOOD.
l8l0xy	1	48	Robinhood has become the worst trading platform.
l8l0xy	2	103	Blocking shares you can buy, starting with the ones that everyone wanted to buy to save their own skin.
l8l0xy	3	166	Now throwing up a smokescreen and blocking multiple other stocks to make it seem like they are doing this for a bigger reason but we all really know what's happening.
l8l0xy	4	87	Look at Fidelity, I switched from Robinhood to them last year and they've been awesome.
l8l0xy	5	102	Accounts are free to open, $0 commissions, they haven't blocked any stocks throughout this whole saga.
l8l0xy	6	160	It may take signing a couple extra forms to verify your identity with them but you also get a great customer service team to help answer any questions you have.
l8l0xy	7	140	Any platform that gets to choose what stocks its retail investors can buy is completely bullshit, IF WE LIKE THE STOCK LET US BUY THE STOCK.

l8jx4p	1	154	I could convince some business partners with quite some buying power to hop on the silver train and hence need some information on potential future deals.
l8jx4p	2	107	We're based in Europe and as far as I can tell, there are only american Silver futures available CMEgroup .
l8jx4p	3	43	I don't have experience in trading futures.
l8jx4p	4	48	So here are some open questions regarding this .
l8jx4p	5	103	Can we as europeans trade CME silver futures and can we let them deliver to a warehouse in our Country?
l8jx4p	6	35	If yes, what about shipment costs?.
l8jx4p	7	11	reference .
l8jx4p	8	58	There it's mentioned that March is an active future month.
l8jx4p	9	20	What does that mean?
l8jx4p	10	48	Physical delivery can only take place in march?.
l8jx4p	11	32	Additionally, fellow europeans .
l8jx4p	12	56	any idea about upcoming taxes for the physical delivery?
l8jx4p	13	59	We have to pay VAT for buying silver here as far as I know.
l8jx4p	14	4	So .
l8jx4p	15	52	do you think the physical delivery is even possible?
l8jx4p	16	16	Also to Europe?.
l8jx4p	17	15	let's do this!.

l92ma1	2	65	What's good newcomers, OG's, Millennials, Boomers, boys, girls, .
l92ma1	3	3	, .
l92ma1	4	12	and former .
l92ma1	5	15	tweet enjoyers.
l92ma1	6	12	OBLIGATORY .
l92ma1	7	5	$GME.
l92ma1	8	57	YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS .
l92ma1	9	77	It's ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!.
l92ma1	10	293	"Hold onto your seats, because what I'm about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another \"squeeze opportunity\"."
l92ma1	11	154	Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME .
l92ma1	12	112	The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe.
l92ma1	13	202	Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use?
l92ma1	14	274	Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people's lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn't need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you.
l92ma1	15	34	So here is where the story begins.
l92ma1	16	226	Robinhood as many of you know was heavily funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. Morgan weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day .
l92ma1	17	35	as the first balanced mutual fund .
l92ma1	18	157	Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface.
l92ma1	19	29	"Check out \"Citadel Connect\" ."
l92ma1	20	132	which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages.
l92ma1	21	84	So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least.
l92ma1	22	106	They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more!
l92ma1	23	102	Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange.
l92ma1	24	218	Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having MORE retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was DATA .
l92ma1	25	168	Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying .
l92ma1	26	309	buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away , this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat.
l92ma1	27	99	Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY usually .
l92ma1	28	21	So Robinhood Citadel.
l92ma1	29	18	Next is JP Morgan.
l92ma1	30	11	The banker.
l92ma1	31	17	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
l92ma1	32	8	Wait up.
l92ma1	33	60	A Morgan started the original Citadel Wellington , remember?
l92ma1	34	32	Seems like a killer coincidence!
l92ma1	35	43	Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont?
l92ma1	36	51	Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name.
l92ma1	37	69	hmmm weird, but I can't seem to find any relation on good old Google!
l92ma1	38	42	So we'll leave this just as a coincidence.
l92ma1	39	19	Back to JP Morgan .
l92ma1	40	197	they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money.
l92ma1	41	194	They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.
l92ma1	42	91	This is where $SLV Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.
l92ma1	43	89	For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust which is blackrock's silver etf .
l92ma1	44	147	The silver squeeze IS something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit SIGNIFICANTLY off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally.
l92ma1	45	10	JP Morgan.
l92ma1	46	19	How'd they do this?
l92ma1	47	32	They shorted the fuck out of it.
l92ma1	48	63	Check out JP Morgan's history with the precious metals market .
l92ma1	49	56	They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits.
l92ma1	50	211	"Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes \"viral\" and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the \"next squeeze\", but maybe just a coincidence, right?"
l92ma1	51	63	Recap Robinhood Citadel JP Morgan would be the defaulted order.
l92ma1	52	131	JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?.
l92ma1	53	32	Hence why $SLV has became viral.
l92ma1	54	14	So in essence.
l92ma1	55	79	Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you're doing.
l92ma1	56	28	Our mission is to focus on .
l92ma1	57	8	ing GME.
l92ma1	58	56	EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING SHILLED IS A DISTRACTION .
l92ma1	59	87	Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood.
l92ma1	60	118	Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.
l92ma1	61	11	$SLV CREW .
l92ma1	62	16	GME & AMC CREW .
l92ma1	63	105	TLDR HOLD GME IT IS A REALLY GREAT STOCK , SLV IS DISTRACTION at least during this , BUY TANGIBLE SILVER.
l92ma1	64	192	IT IS IN JPM'S BEST INTEREST AT THIS POINT FOR GME TO FALL AND THEY ARE DOING DAMAGE CONTROL TO RECOUP LOSSES BY SHILLING SLV AND THEN SHORTING BECAUSE BLACKROCK HAS A MASSIVE POSITION IN GME.

l8zy5h	0	188	Is it possible that Hedge Funds were covering their shorts & rebuying them on the way up, and that the time pressure for them to get out of their short position isn't as dire as we think?.
l8zy5h	1	62	Not trying to be a negative nancy here, I'm genuinely curious.
l8zy5h	2	203	In thinking about the ways that GME may or may not play out next week, a thought struck me and I'd like some input that may dictate how long I and maybe others, if other people have purchased this stock.
l8zy5h	3	16	should hold for.
l8zy5h	4	159	Say they started covering their $15 shorts at $100, then re bought shorts at $150, then $200, etc, then covered their $150 shorts and re bought shorts at $300.
l8zy5h	5	89	It could still very well be a 126% short interest, just that the shorts are now at $300..
l8zy5h	6	206	This would probably mean that they would have a lot less interest to pay to hold the shorts, and may have a longer lifeline than any single investor who likes $GME would want to hold on to their shares for.
l8zy5h	7	27	Can you offer any insight?.
l8zure	0	143	How the financial press is misrepresenting $GME, getting basic facts comically wrong, and generally trying to spin this in Wall Street's favor.
l8zure	1	57	Greetings from your friendly hedge fund industry insider.
l8zure	2	47	See here for my last missive to the community .
l8zure	3	259	I want to check in because I've been getting confirmation privately that the hedge funds are hurting while publicly the news articles are saying they're doing fine my confidence in WSB's power to upend the market with its collective power has gotten stronger.
l8zure	4	39	That's not why I'm writing now, though.
l8zure	5	61	I want to show you how the misinformation train keeps coming.
l8zure	6	13	Don't get on.
l8zure	7	461	"First, here's the funniest example of the media getting shit wrong I've seen in a while on the Bloomberg podcast The Tape on January 28, Kathy Burton, the hedge fund reporter for Bloomberg, discusses her piece on the trend dismissively by calling WSB a bunch of \"Reddit bros\" and saying WSB targeted several stocks Melvin Capital had shorted not true GME was the only target, and it was targeted because of its overall SI, not because of Melvin or its founder ."
l8zure	8	26	That's not the worst part.
l8zure	9	102	"The worst part is Burton repeatedly calls GME \"Gameshop\" I'm not kidding, go to 26 40 in the podcast ."
l8zure	10	83	If you're going to report on a company, maybe get the company name right, k Kathy?.
l8zure	11	45	Now look at this post It's fucking horseshit.
l8zure	12	329	"First, BlackRock and JPMorgan dismiss the trend as something that will come and go they wish and they blame the Federal Reserve \"It is not surprising when you think about how much liquidity is in the system, how much policy has fueled asset prices in recent weeks and months\" is what Hildebrand, Vice Chairman of Blackrock said ."
l8zure	13	138	Now, Blackrock is a former client of mine, and I can say this because they're no longer a client and I haven't worked with them for years.
l8zure	14	154	One of the worst stock picks and theses behind that stock pick I ever saw was from a portfolio manager at Blackrock who managed many billions of dollars .
l8zure	15	98	Not everyone at Blackrock is bad I've met some very smart people there , but not everyone is good.
l8zure	16	82	So even if someone at Blackrock dismisses GME in good faith, it doesn't mean shit.
l8zure	17	139	But Hildebrand is talking in bad faith, clearly, because she wants higher interest rates so financial firms can lend money at higher rates.
l8zure	18	41	It's very likely self serving dishonesty.
l8zure	19	56	Then there's the fact that what he said isn't even true.
l8zure	20	261	Money velocity remains at record low levels, indicating liquidity IN THE REAL ECONOMY is not high unsurprising since QE is a very ineffective means of getting money into the hands of ordinary people which is not the Fed's fault, as that's not really their job .
l8zure	21	59	Plus, asset prices aren't showing a bubbly tendency at all.
l8zure	22	134	Note how Hildebrand doesn't address the fact that the Nasdaq 100 went down over 4% last week hardly the sign of a stock market bubble.
l8zure	23	18	He's full of shit.
l8zure	24	40	That isn't the worst part of this story.
l8zure	25	250	Perhaps the most egregious example of how Wall Street is trying to spin this in their favor is Anne Richards, Fidelity International CEO, who said in an interview that the GME situation shows why there should be LESS transparency for shorting stocks.
l8zure	26	23	I'm quoting Bloomberg .
l8zure	27	157	"\"The thing that they could do very very quickly is remove the transparency on where the big shorts are, because that seems to be the trigger,\" Richards said."
l8zure	28	134	"\"But then of course that takes away from that market transparency which everybody wanted to put in place after the financial crisis.\"."
l8zure	29	323	She does NOT suggest that there should be MORE market transparency so that investors know how much a hedge fund shorts a stock and when it shorts, so that big shorts can't accumulate and trigger an event like $GME mooning no, the market needs LESS transparency, she says, so that retail investors can't squeeze hedge funds.
l8zure	30	134	This is obvious bullshit, and the fact that it went unchallenged on Bloomberg is a testament to how shoddy their journalism really is.
l8zure	31	253	Bloomberg has been the place that gave massive platforms to hucksters like Dennis Gartman, a newsletter writer who was a punchline on Wall Street we would always say he's the best contrarian indicator on the market, just do the opposite of what he does.
l8zure	32	257	Gartmen quit his newsletter in 2019, which cost thousands of dollars to subscribe to annually, after getting regular interviews on Bloomberg where he was treated as an expert for the unknowing public despite his appalling track record and constant failures.
l8zure	33	109	Now Bloomberg is giving a platform to WS players who are trying to spin the story to deregulate the industry.
l8zure	34	26	Absolutely fucking unreal.
l8zure	35	27	Or, well, it isn't, really.
l8zure	36	53	I have seen this happen in my decade in the industry.
l8zure	37	98	I have seen mainstream news articles on reports I've written that get those reports exactly wrong.
l8zure	38	261	"I remember one report in particular where the headline was ambiguous, but the report was very clearly positive on the stock for reason X. The news report from one outlet possibly Bloomberg said something like \"Analyst bearish on stock for reason Opposite of X\"."
l8zure	39	113	It was really funny, and since correcting the record wasn't good for my employer's business, we didn't bother to.
l8zure	40	137	That's just one of many examples of fuckery I have from the financial press, so this misinformation garbage does not surprise me one bit.
l8zure	41	39	Tldr read the whole post you lazy fuck.
l8zure	42	131	But if you can't read, here's the deal the financial press's activist misinformation campaign is getting more and more transparent.

l8w9bj	0	101	New Reddit accounts are allegedly being stolen to generate fake market sentiment around memestonks!!!
l8w9bj	1	74	MODS DON'T DELETE FOR FUCK SAKE THIS IS POTENTIALLY CRITICAL INFORMATION!.
l8w9bj	2	101	I'm a generic europoor who went all in on GME with all my spare cash and I'm active on the subreddit.
l8w9bj	3	49	Revolut was is the app I'm using to trade stonks.
l8w9bj	4	197	If you can please just ignore me being a scared shitless paperhanded moron for a few seconds I still own 101 GME shares though , check this screenshot below, or go read the comments yourself here .
l8w9bj	5	111	Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks.
l8w9bj	6	129	We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.
l8w9bj	7	195	This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week.
l8w9bj	8	314	"Notice how it says \". this thing is happening in the next few days.\" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks."
l8w9bj	9	304	"I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to \"normal levels\" fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit ."
l8w9bj	10	106	Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?.

l8vs9u	1	72	This is not advice, merely insight based on mu relevant past experience.
l8vs9u	2	75	I worked for the company for over 4 years, 1.5 of which as a store manager.
l8vs9u	3	89	I'm not a financial advisor, just a lowly retard with my 2 shares bought at around $300..
l8vs9u	4	83	Just a point of interest GameStop makes almost nothing from new game console sales.
l8vs9u	5	147	The absolute best thing that you can do for the company from a business perspective is bring some stuff to trade, get the membership, and buy used.
l8vs9u	6	85	It also helps the employees there as they are HEAVILY pressured to meet these quotas.
l8vs9u	7	38	This will probably get deleted anyway.

l8uszo	0	13	The Big Long.
l8uszo	1	44	I was doing something today called thinking.
l8uszo	2	139	This whole situation is so outlandish, farfetched, beyond imagination something just doesn't smell right, or feel right, at least in my pp.
l8uszo	3	105	And so, I came, after looking at DFVs current positions again but after that, I came up with a question .
l8uszo	4	74	How do big firms like Melvin short over 100% and expect nobody to notice?.
l8uszo	5	9	Or maybe.
l8uszo	6	41	perhaps they did expect people to notice.
l8uszo	7	51	What if Melvin and co. is actually IN on the play?.
l8uszo	8	75	What if they saw the short interest was very high, close to or above 100% .
l8uszo	9	159	and came up with the plan to add short positions to increase the short interest to levels that will be picked up and acted on by other firms retail investors .
l8uszo	10	28	and trigger a short squeeze.
l8uszo	11	107	BUT preemptively get out of their short positions, and before they have to report their long positions etc.
l8uszo	12	71	Because their newer, unreported positions will be all on the LONG side.
l8uszo	13	167	The 'bailout' may have been necessary to increase their long positions further, or perhaps they were caught in the squeeze much faster than they had initially thought.
l8uszo	14	68	It could be the biggest bait and switch in recent financial history.
l8uszo	15	36	The gain porn would be unimaginable.
l8uszo	16	118	In the fractionally tiny chance that I'm right, I've posted this to my research related twitter account LimeResearch .
l8uszo	17	136	no affiliation to shitron just in case I'm right, I want to have the proof timestamped in two places for my movie book deals of course .

l8uqmg	0	47	Let's talk about $INTC, let's talk about $AMD .
l8uqmg	1	29	TL DR This autist likes $AMD.
l8uqmg	2	98	I've held AMD since November 2015 $1.94 and have weathered these speculative downturns many times.
l8uqmg	3	105	IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return.
l8uqmg	4	67	This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons .
l8uqmg	5	83	1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove.
l8uqmg	6	75	Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86 64..
l8uqmg	7	137	2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around.
l8uqmg	8	70	Serioulsy retards, look at AAPL when Steve Jobs returned in July 1997.
l8uqmg	9	62	The stock peaked briefly in 2000 before quickly tanking again.
l8uqmg	10	91	It took the goddam legendary Steve Jobs 5 years to achieve a sustained turn around at AAPL.

l8ssek	0	42	What will happen long term with Gamestop?.
l8ssek	1	20	Lets talk Phase III.
l8ssek	2	113	Melvin and others who are doing the ladder shorts, scaring a few to get shares but not enough to save themselves.
l8ssek	3	77	Ive read that Melvin and others are paying 3% daily interest on their shorts.
l8ssek	4	77	Lets assume a $1B short that went against them to the tune of $10B in losses.
l8ssek	5	69	They are effectively paying 3% or $300M a day to maintain that short.
l8ssek	6	104	Only they can't get out because there are no true sellers, just bullshit ladder games by other shorters.
l8ssek	7	73	Eventually Melvin cannot pay that $300M $1.5B a week margije requirement.
l8ssek	8	96	The price increases and their short goes red $20B, now they have $600M a day to carry the short.
l8ssek	9	20	Just can't continue.
l8ssek	10	76	So they become insolvent, and a bigger firm assumes the risk of their short.
l8ssek	11	75	GME hits $10K a share and now that bigger firm has a $3B a day margin risk!
l8ssek	12	13	They go down.
l8ssek	13	84	Two ways this works out for the shorts, 1, enough people cash out so they can cover.
l8ssek	14	58	2 Gamestop themselves sell massive shares into the frenzy.
l8ssek	15	202	They get to Cohen and he releases millions of shares, GME files an action to raise capital to restructure and sells 100M shares to do that directly to hedges at a predetermined price so they can cover .
l8ssek	16	22	Lets talk what if now.

l95k8j	1	73	Hello, your fellow retard who knows literally nothing about trading here.
l95k8j	2	45	I was checking out GME on TDA's ToS platform.
l95k8j	3	146	When I go under the options section, you have the ability to check out options at all the major dates and can change the data you are able to see.
l95k8j	4	136	I am able to see ' open interest which if I'm not mistaken are all of the options open everywhere, aggregated for me to see aren't they?
l95k8j	5	192	So can I not add up all of these open interests for strikes and get the total contract amount for puts and figure out how many shares are left on the short side and when they would be needed?.
l95k8j	6	103	Also I know you are able to rollback shorts but how expensive is it to roll them back and for how long?
l95k8j	7	188	1 29 had more open interest contracts than any other date so it's likely the date that they're most likely to roll them back on if they think they're going to be able to shake GME holders.
l95k8j	8	75	Do these open interest contracts then appear next week on 2 5 expiry date?.
l95k8j	9	28	Thanks for the help R tards.
l95k8j	10	75	Edit the first thing I said is I know fucking nothing you god damn retards.

l9afjk	0	22	Why all this matters .
l9afjk	1	40	my GME story and how the system used me.
l9afjk	2	106	This is my story of how companies like Robinhood take advantage of the fact that individually we are weak.
l9afjk	3	121	I am a small time investor and member of the WSB community and I like to support even though my pockets aren't that deep.
l9afjk	4	67	Since I am from the EU I use Etoro because we don't have Robinhood.
l9afjk	5	103	On 29 12 20 I bought a small amount of shares 4.7 in $GME with plans on holding for as long as I could.
l9afjk	6	164	My portfolio is really small but I do have one leveraged position at x2 for just a couple hundred with no money in my bankroll since all my money is in open trades.
l9afjk	7	194	On 08 01 21 the day of a big dip in my leveraged position I receive an email from Etoro giving me only a couple hours notice before they close my position at a loss which I didn't want to take .
l9afjk	8	436	"\"Due to extreme market volatility in the markets, margin positions for all leveraged positions is increasing to 100 percent. This applies to both CFD and real leveraged positions.. . If you do not increase the margin to 100 percent then the position will be closed at 21 00 GMT today Friday January 8, 2021 . The invested amounts in these positions, together with any profit or loss incurred, will be returned to your account balance.\"."
l9afjk	9	177	Basically, I had been in profit along with many others and they decided this dip was their chance to cut some losses and force out the small guys, taking profits for themselves.
l9afjk	10	237	Sadly I didn't have enough to cover in my bank account so I had to sell off my entire portfolio in order to stop them from closing my leveraged trade, selling out stocks I owned like $GME at a loss in order to prevent an even bigger one.
l9afjk	11	155	They tell us what we can and cant do with our own money, they tell us we can play the game but really they make up the rules as they go so they always win.

l9vpuf	0	39	My Theory for why the S3 data is wrong.
l9vpuf	1	110	Disclaimer I hold GME and I am retarded, so this is probably wrong, but it is definitely not financial advice.
l9vpuf	2	52	Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did .
l9vpuf	3	40	Let's say Melvbitch is short 100 shares.
l9vpuf	4	129	He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them?
l9vpuf	5	6	Calls.
l9vpuf	6	136	So, he buys a $0.5 1 29 call and exercises it we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn't trigger a gamma squeeze .
l9vpuf	7	81	But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that?
l9vpuf	8	12	Calls again.
l9vpuf	9	82	So, he sells 4 5 based on what I am seeing value wise OTM calls to get this money.
l9vpuf	10	92	This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES.
l9vpuf	11	63	He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position.
l9vpuf	12	93	If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically.
l9vpuf	13	119	But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday.
l9vpuf	14	71	Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no.
l9vpuf	15	94	Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out?
l9vpuf	16	4	Yes.
l9vpuf	17	68	Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed.
l9vpuf	18	135	Tldr if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares.
l9vpuf	19	5	GME .
l9vpuf	20	71	Edit someone pls correct me if the S3 data would catch assigned shares.

l9sgdi	3	66	But in the midst of this all, I'm worried about my fellow retards.
l9sgdi	4	136	When the squeeze squozes and you eventually sell somewhere between $10,000 and $1,000,000 share price you're going to have to pay taxes!
l9sgdi	5	102	Don't be one of those morons that makes 100k, spends it all and then has no money to pay 35k in taxes.

l9r410	1	6	HOLD .
l9r410	2	31	NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION.
l9r410	3	86	I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations.
l9r410	4	194	This is particularly true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution.
l9r410	5	111	The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.
l9r410	6	142	The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition.
l9r410	7	94	What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached.
l9r410	8	59	There is a reason why the plan was made prior, in the calm.
l9r410	9	27	Remember, we are dumb ass .
l9r410	10	33	figuratively and quite literally.
l9r410	11	50	Everything you do should be done with calm intent.
l9r410	12	96	That means, if you planned to hold no matter what, DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.
l9r410	13	151	If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.
l9r410	14	90	If you plan to sell buy, set your limits and DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.
l9r410	15	106	If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan?
l9r410	16	11	Go have a .
l9r410	17	19	if tempted to peek.
l9r410	18	112	The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake 99.9999% of the time.
l9r410	19	71	In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea.
l9r410	20	97	The time for open mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams.
l9r410	21	80	Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.
l9r410	22	73	Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results.
l9r410	23	118	If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made.
l9r410	24	59	This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.
l9r410	25	115	TL DR Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.
l9r410	26	107	No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time.

l9qsqf	3	70	I feel like we are just be puppets to some of these hedge funds plans.
l9qsqf	4	75	Why did Citadel and point72 made it public in their investment into Melvin?

l9pg4u	0	16	To the newcomer.
l9pg4u	1	154	Just a reminder, especially if you're new here, you're not in competition with anyone else on your market account, your financial net worth, or your life.
l9pg4u	2	115	It's easy to look at the million dollar yolo paydays on here and get jealous, bitter, or simply disheartened at it.
l9pg4u	3	54	Perhaps even just look at it as if it was an easy day.
l9pg4u	4	128	But remember most didn't start with a trust fund, they started with a small amount and rolled it into a bigger amount over time.
l9pg4u	5	91	It's easy to watch someone play a musical instrument and think it looks easy until you try.
l9pg4u	6	24	Trading is the same way.
l9pg4u	7	88	It looks easy but it takes time and practice to figure out a system that works for you .
l9pg4u	8	103	And many here have blown their accounts up, losing everything , on bad bets and have had to start over.
l9pg4u	9	150	I've even seen people get genuinely suicidal over losing it all after risking way more than they should have and ending up on the wrong side of a bet.
l9pg4u	10	148	The stock market is an unforgiving environment, and if money or money making becomes your life you can easily lose it trying to grasp more and more.
l9pg4u	11	128	There's way more to life than money, but if you're going to play here you need to know what you're doing and the risks involved.
l9pg4u	12	116	Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.
l9pg4u	13	82	With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode thus far even more so.
l9pg4u	14	59	Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much NOT .
l9pg4u	15	75	After these plays are over and one day they will be , there will be others.
l9pg4u	16	124	You'll have to do your own homework like DFV did for years before anyone knew who he was on potential stock picks and plays.
l9pg4u	17	86	Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.
l9pg4u	18	74	I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.
l9pg4u	19	51	It was a decent value play with a very high upside.
l9pg4u	20	44	But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.
l9pg4u	21	59	The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.
l9pg4u	22	136	Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.
l9pg4u	23	94	This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.
l9pg4u	24	56	Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.
l9pg4u	25	71	Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.
l9pg4u	26	34	WSB isn't your normal trading sub.
l9pg4u	27	37	This is a place for high stakes bets.
l9pg4u	28	127	All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.
l9pg4u	29	91	If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.
l9pg4u	30	76	r finance r investing and or r stocks might be better options if you're new.
l9pg4u	31	184	Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free investopedia is a fine one imo .
l9pg4u	32	87	You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.
l9pg4u	33	16	Don't be stupid.

l9ozhd	2	289	The details of the contract are a little muddled at this time but it appears to be a seasonal contract, as in they Palantir software is only available to Girl Scouts of America during the summer months so they don't have to be paying during the wintertime when they can't fundraise anyway.

l9ozfe	6	99	Citadel can suck my musty nuts ffs it's like you have to put AFTER THE SQUEEZE in any non GME post.
l9ozfe	7	49	Now what IS the move in 2021, is cannabis stocks.
l9ozfe	8	244	You can see my post history for a more in depth post, but here's what you need to know Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is already planning to combine multiple marijuana bills and has said marijuana will be a priority of the 117th Congress.
l9ozfe	9	125	Vice President Kushala Harris was the Senate sponsor of the MORE act, which among other things would provide banking reform .
l9ozfe	10	27	So what does all this mean?
l9ozfe	11	90	This means $CGC, $APHA, $CRON, $TLRY and most other cannabis stocks are fueling up for a .

l9ozfe	13	72	Including the entire country of Mexico legalizing marijuana this April .
l9ozfe	14	165	So AFTER THE SQUEEZE HAS SQUOZE, do you wanna make Citadel more money OR do you wanna put your dollars into the change you hope to see over the next couple of years?
l9ozfe	15	98	I know the decision is easy for myself, and it's up to each one of you to make your own decisions.
l9ozfe	16	88	This isn't advice, and the only advice I do have for you is Blue crayons taste the best.
l9oy0u	0	43	Why DID Robinhood halt trading on Thursday?
l9oy0u	1	34	A hypothesis from a fellow autist.
l9oy0u	2	33	Consider the following timeline .
l9oy0u	3	171	Once upon a time, hedge funds and brokerages decided GME was a dog and is the easiest money they've ever made and place positions puts betting that the price will go down.
l9oy0u	4	80	They placed bets to the tune of 140% of nominal value of all shares outstanding.
l9oy0u	5	285	Some autists on Reddit identify this massive naked short bet and don't feel their beloved GME who they have DEEP SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS for is quite the dog its being made out to be and so, just for fun, start buying the stock and placing call options, betting that the price will go up.
l9oy0u	6	59	They talk about it on WSB because that's what we do on WSB.
l9oy0u	7	50	Taking contrary positions is what autists do best.
l9oy0u	8	48	They almost WILL their beloved Gamestop to rise.
l9oy0u	9	8	It does.
l9oy0u	10	53	Disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say WTF?
l9oy0u	11	83	This cant be happening That's what celebrities said during the Great Fappening too.
l9oy0u	12	18	It still happened.
l9oy0u	13	84	The ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making REAL money.
l9oy0u	14	103	Wuuuut, you can transfer money to Robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options?
l9oy0u	15	21	How hard can this be?
l9oy0u	16	98	People who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing.
l9oy0u	17	13	Word spreads.
l9oy0u	18	19	More join the fray.
l9oy0u	19	15	More huge wins.
l9oy0u	20	11	Loooks fun!
l9oy0u	21	31	More and more and more jump in.
l9oy0u	22	64	Meanwhile in hedgietown, things are looking really fucking dire.
l9oy0u	23	30	WTF are these autists doing???
l9oy0u	24	43	This CAN'T be happening heeelp I'm melting.
l9oy0u	25	105	They watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than Robinhood.
l9oy0u	26	137	Not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible.
l9oy0u	27	232	"On the \"wrong side\" of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on Wall Street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets."
l9oy0u	28	4	Doh.
l9oy0u	29	28	We done fucked up this time.
l9oy0u	30	10	Wuuuuuut?.
l9oy0u	31	48	The ground swell on Reddit turns into a tsunami.
l9oy0u	32	28	It starts to make the news .
l9oy0u	33	39	A strategy coalesces among the autists.
l9oy0u	34	4	Hey!
l9oy0u	35	46	If we hold and don't sell wont the price rise?
l9oy0u	36	19	It appears to work.
l9oy0u	37	116	Hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and haven't bathed or shaved in three days.
l9oy0u	38	102	They are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water.
l9oy0u	39	104	Increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers, bankers and brokerage principals.
l9oy0u	40	137	On Wednesday January 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the CEO of a private firm called Robinhood Holdings.
l9oy0u	41	17	An offer is made.
l9oy0u	42	15	Hedgies Hey V .
l9oy0u	43	35	Great little company you got there.
l9oy0u	44	48	It would be a shame if it no longer existed say.
l9oy0u	45	109	next Monday, because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded US financial markets.
l9oy0u	46	19	Wouldn't you agree?
l9oy0u	47	24	RH Silence on the line .
l9oy0u	48	75	Hedgies Here's a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening.
l9oy0u	49	69	"We need you to halt buying on GME on your platform for a \"few hours\"."
l9oy0u	50	29	Can you do that favor for us?
l9oy0u	51	97	If you do, we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive.
l9oy0u	52	90	This will have long term benefits for everyone including you and Robinhood, we assure you.
l9oy0u	53	52	RH So you are saying this is a systemic risk event?.
l9oy0u	54	39	Hedgies Yes, that's what we are saying.
l9oy0u	55	45	RH But what will we tell our account holders?
l9oy0u	56	34	Hedgies It's only for a few hours.
l9oy0u	57	68	Just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something.
l9oy0u	58	106	In exchange for this favor, we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company.
l9oy0u	59	18	So it's a win win.
l9oy0u	60	51	Would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay?
l9oy0u	61	18	RH A long moment .
l9oy0u	62	10	Yes, okay.
l9oy0u	63	13	Hedgies Done.
l9oy0u	64	17	It's transferred.
l9oy0u	65	155	"Upon reaching the agreement for the \"favor,\" hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on GME for the next day betting the stock will go down on Thursday ."
l9oy0u	66	148	They also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a pre determined time on Friday, betting the price will go up.
l9oy0u	67	162	They know after the halt, a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will trigger their call options.
l9oy0u	68	41	"RH halts buying in GME for \"a few hours\"."
l9oy0u	69	94	The hedgies new shorts placed on Wednesday for Thursday are exercised to the tune of billions.
l9oy0u	70	128	"When \"limited\" buying resumes on Friday, per plan, the price for GME shares rockets higher, triggering the hedgies call strikes."
l9oy0u	71	111	Hypothetically speaking, how much could one make if one were a hedgie manipulating saving the market like this?
l9oy0u	72	22	Billions and billions.
l9oy0u	73	96	How much did hedgies need to unwind their positions last Friday, 24 hours before this occurred??
l9oy0u	74	22	Billions and billions.
l9oy0u	75	46	Hypothetically, that's an amazing coincidence.
l9oy0u	76	87	Given this hypothetical, would it be enough to unwind more than their Friday positions?
l9oy0u	77	14	How much more?
l9oy0u	78	5	None?
l9oy0u	79	6	Some?.
l9oy0u	80	44	Dunno, WSB I'm just another retard like you.
l9oy0u	81	58	As proof of that I sold GME on Tuesday at 80 and bough BB.
l9oy0u	82	26	Don't be retarded like me.
l9oy0u	83	52	HOLD THE DAMN LINE but expect more tricks this week.
l9oy0u	84	22	Goodluck and godspeed.
l9oxs8	0	92	We need to spend more effort on crowdsourcing information on the things that we want to buy.
l9oxs8	1	69	Not just stocks on the market but more importantly consumer products.
l9oxs8	2	56	This information will help us make more informed trades.
l9oxs8	3	12	Hear me out.
l9oxs8	4	24	We are retail investors.
l9oxs8	5	30	But we are also the consumers.
l9oxs8	6	102	We know what we want, what our friends want, and what our family members want to buy on a daily basis.
l9oxs8	7	44	Use that information and tell the subreddit.
l9oxs8	8	24	We are also the workers.
l9oxs8	9	27	We know what everyone buys.
l9oxs8	10	104	If you work in retail, start paying attention to trends of what people buy and tell us on the subreddit.
l9oxs8	11	77	If you work in manufacturing, are there a lot of orders or fewer than normal?
l9oxs8	12	18	We'd like to know.
l9oxs8	13	105	Corporations spend billions of dollars each year for consumer research to inform them on what to produce.
l9oxs8	14	36	We already possess that information.
l9oxs8	15	131	On an internet forum with millions of people we have the ability to have a competitive independent research apparatus that is free.
l9oxs8	16	38	That is such a huge advantage we have.
l9oxs8	17	231	"It must be difficult for some hedge fund investor who is in their office all day to really understand what people want and are willing to buy in \"the outside world.\" They aren't buying cheap consumer products bc they don't have to."
l9oxs8	18	37	They can't buy the knowledge we have.
l9oxs8	19	90	As investors, we need to think about investing as opposed to trading for short term gains.
l9oxs8	20	203	We can influence a company that produces a specific product that we think people want, build it up, and that company with its newfound capital that we gave it will make that product that people will buy.
l9oxs8	21	17	AND WE WILL MAKE.
l9oxs8	22	8	FUCKING.
l9oxs8	23	5	BANK.
l9oxs8	24	37	We have 7 million people in this sub.
l9oxs8	25	11	7 MILLION!!
l9oxs8	26	117	The newbies can participate just as much as the veterans as a source of free research and information in this regard.
l9oxs8	27	68	The veterans in return can teach the newbies how to invest properly.
l9oxs8	28	50	Everyone wins if we put our 40 IQ brains together.
l9oxs8	29	130	Mods, please start a weekly thread about market and consumer information so we can have our very own and free research department.
l9op4e	0	10	Us vs Them
l9oo9m	0	24	Why It's Smart to Hold .
l9oo9m	1	42	Capitalism 101 and Media Manipulation 101.
l9oo9m	2	29	This is not financial advice.
l9oo9m	3	65	I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only.
l9oo9m	4	51	This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.
l9oo9m	5	55	What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.
l9oo9m	6	47	First, an overview of what happened last week .
l9oo9m	7	105	There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.
l9oo9m	8	72	Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.
l9oo9m	9	127	Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY no more limits!
l9oo9m	10	50	, and relaxing the share call restrictions on NOK.
l9oo9m	11	118	"Cramer said last Friday that GME holders \"already won,\" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk \"immense pain\"."
l9oo9m	12	88	CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.
l9oo9m	13	60	Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.
l9oo9m	14	109	"CNBC also bought \"paid promotions\" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions."
l9oo9m	15	74	Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive.
l9oo9m	16	54	I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses.
l9oo9m	17	131	"If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in \"the stocks we like\"."
l9oo9m	18	4	Why?
l9oo9m	19	47	Maybe because Melvin still has short positions.
l9oo9m	20	48	They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards.
l9oo9m	21	163	Except, the bigs f d up their media manipulation strategy or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium , and I foresee even greater losses for them.
l9oo9m	22	12	Here's why .
l9oo9m	23	28	1 Don't Think of Elephants .
l9oo9m	24	101	Quoting JGL's character in Inception , what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants?
l9oo9m	25	23	You think of elephants.
l9oo9m	26	89	Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them.
l9oo9m	27	137	"Also, they actually made each of the \"do not buy a lot\" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand."
l9oo9m	28	97	Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks.
l9oo9m	29	46	This strategy worked for California groceries.
l9oo9m	30	167	Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single use plastic bags.
l9oo9m	31	61	You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea.
l9oo9m	32	11	Not really.
l9oo9m	33	14	It's too late.
l9oo9m	34	108	If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E Trade, if not now, then later.
l9oo9m	35	63	Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem.
l9oo9m	36	35	They already tarnished their brand.
l9oo9m	37	92	"It's too late to add fees now, because it will be \"on top of\" all the bs they did last week."
l9oo9m	38	71	"They needed to choose the \"less bad\" decision and picked the worse one."
l9oo9m	39	38	2 Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction FUD .
l9oo9m	40	199	"So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that \"retail investors will be in for some real pain\"."
l9oo9m	41	34	Do we believe what they're saying?
l9oo9m	42	5	Nope.
l9oo9m	43	112	Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying?
l9oo9m	44	62	Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions.
l9oo9m	45	28	Thursday's GME low was $112.
l9oo9m	46	73	If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday.
l9oo9m	47	17	3 Opportunities .
l9oo9m	48	29	Black Friday of the Century .
l9oo9m	49	17	Hold your stonks.
l9oo9m	50	16	Hold your leaps.
l9oo9m	51	111	There's gonna be an immense, pent up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood.
l9oo9m	52	94	They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come.
l9oo9m	53	93	If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them.
l9oo9m	54	45	Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane.
l9oo9m	55	33	Retail Arbitrage of the Century .
l9oo9m	56	136	"If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E trade or Ameritrade, Buy those \"do not buy a lot of\" stocks you can't get on Robinhood."
l9oo9m	57	108	It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks.
l9oo9m	58	19	Not gonna say more.
l9oo9m	59	7	TL DR .
l9oo9m	60	57	There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media.
l9oo9m	61	27	Melvin is not in the clear.
l9oo9m	62	147	We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure.
l9oo9m	63	84	"Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from \"done\"."

l9nc0j	2	89	Don't fundamentals imply that highly shorted companies are vulnerable to a short squeeze?

l9mmvb	0	31	Which would you rather regret?.
l9mmvb	1	135	IMO there is no way to watch what is happening with GME and others and not come out without some level of regret and hindsight remorse.
l9mmvb	2	407	The decision over whether or not to buy into this hype, or how much to buy, comes down to one question that you have to answer for yourself would you rather regret losing some amount of money if the stock ends up going down, or would you rather regret staying on the sidelines and watching all these other retarded monkeys fill their cages with so many bananas they don't even know what to do with them all?
l9mmvb	3	200	I think this is an interesting way to frame it and I had a moment of clarity last night that I would way rather lose a few thousand if this goes to zero than watch this go to 5k and not be part of it.
l9mmvb	4	156	As others have said, you are paying to be part of history, this is a donation to the cause, this is insurance against wishing you had some skin in the game.
l9mmvb	5	19	5000 is not a meme.

l9looo	2	59	They've had the weekend to decide what they're going to do.
l9looo	3	156	If I was in their shoes, allowing a game squeeze to 1000 and knocking the price down because they think people will sell is not a bad move for them to make.
l9looo	4	93	Think about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still.
l9looo	5	120	we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow.
l9looo	6	54	The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK.
l9looo	7	36	It's the way that GME gets squeezed.
l9looo	8	39	A realistic way is if we maintain hype.
l9looo	9	45	Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood.
l9looo	10	44	Remember that we are not actually organized.
l9looo	11	74	And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME.
l9looo	12	100	The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming.
l9looo	13	36	We need the eurobros to hold for us.
l9looo	14	64	They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind.
l9looo	15	16	Do not let them.

l9looo	23	82	EDIT 4 To answer some questions Fidelity is an app that is currently unrestricted.
l9looo	24	177	Buy game at your own discretion, I firmly believe that shorts haven't covered, and that the massive amounts of bots and MM is proof that they're getting more worried by the day.

l9k7mp	1	33	Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
l9k7mp	2	126	Obligatory I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
l9k7mp	3	90	This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.
l9k7mp	4	16	Tldr at bottom .
l9k7mp	5	112	Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors.
l9k7mp	6	111	We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.
l9k7mp	7	142	We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.
l9k7mp	8	102	So here's the skinny No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet.
l9k7mp	9	17	They are holding.
l9k7mp	10	32	But what if their capital left?.
l9k7mp	11	40	The questions needed to be answered are.
l9k7mp	12	47	"1. \"what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC."
l9k7mp	13	132	2. Who do they manage funds for is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like .
l9k7mp	14	137	3. Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?.
l9k7mp	15	208	4. Can retail legally , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a or many reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?.
l9k7mp	16	128	I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window.
l9k7mp	17	45	Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb.
l9k7mp	18	95	It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way.
l9k7mp	19	100	But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.
l9k7mp	20	86	Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.
l9k7mp	21	64	Edit to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding.
l9k7mp	22	135	This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk.
l9k7mp	23	181	The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out.
l9k7mp	24	151	Tldr could wsb retain a securities lawyer s to help HF investors e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions.
l9k7mp	25	59	Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate.

l9ieo0	0	63	The last motivational post you'll need for your diamond hands .
l9ieo0	1	33	Alright my monkeybrained buddies.
l9ieo0	2	20	Tendietime, memes, .
l9ieo0	3	7	emojis.
l9ieo0	4	119	, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, its actually much simpler.
l9ieo0	5	124	So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.
l9ieo0	6	9	We know .
l9ieo0	7	42	A Shorts bleed by holding short positions.
l9ieo0	8	43	Shorts desperately want to close positions.
l9ieo0	9	79	B To close, they have to buy stonks from us saw a post earlier help me find it?
l9ieo0	10	34	saying we hold most of the shares.
l9ieo0	11	56	C If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.
l9ieo0	12	123	so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.
l9ieo0	13	108	Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,.
l9ieo0	14	91	"\"why didnt i buy earlier\", \"why didnt i buy more\", \"why did i not take out a fucking loan\"."
l9ieo0	15	50	Im more okay with holding too long than too short.
l9ieo0	16	25	fuck short anyways right?
l9ieo0	17	82	The essence is what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?.
l9ieo0	18	120	"\"yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha?"
l9ieo0	19	449	"now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha\". . Dont be that guy. . Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic \"I love you my lovely toilet tiger\" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes."
l9ieo0	20	7	TL DR .
l9ieo0	21	178	As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.
l9ieo0	22	20	Diamond Hands win, .

l9i036	2	36	More or less an ELI25, not an ELI5 .
l9i036	3	186	Would it be factually accurate to say then that retail traders sending a buy or sell order to Robinhood are having their buy and sell fulfilled by inventory held or dispensed by Citadel?

l9z88h	0	61	Evidence of Massive Naked Short Selling Fraud in GME and AMC.
l9z88h	1	111	First of all, major credit to u johnnydaggers for the original DD If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.
l9z88h	2	155	Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.
l9z88h	3	155	I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company.
l9z88h	4	158	This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.
l9z88h	5	75	Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.
l9z88h	6	217	I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 by weight in the S&P 500 as well as GE as an example of a stock with very low short interest .
l9z88h	7	20	Here's what I found.
l9z88h	8	19	This is not normal.
l9z88h	9	138	Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling.
l9z88h	10	54	For a thorough explanation of this, see this article .
l9z88h	11	58	Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others.
l9z88h	12	57	All had sub 1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD.
l9z88h	13	119	But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks.
l9z88h	14	29	This is known as scaling in .
l9z88h	15	135	I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting.
l9z88h	16	100	What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.
l9z88h	17	9	GameStop.
l9z88h	18	75	The first wave small bet of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019.
l9z88h	19	138	GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a bleak future outlook Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%.
l9z88h	20	54	This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis.
l9z88h	21	34	The stock dropped 36% on the news.
l9z88h	22	20	GME Q1 '19 Earnings.
l9z88h	23	4	Oof.
l9z88h	24	52	But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around.
l9z88h	25	337	Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to reboot with a major strategic update They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.
l9z88h	26	92	Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down.
l9z88h	27	53	This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting.
l9z88h	28	174	The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.
l9z88h	29	78	Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!
l9z88h	30	45	Finally COVID hits the US in March and April.
l9z88h	31	81	Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon.
l9z88h	32	118	This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy.
l9z88h	33	58	Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling.
l9z88h	34	244	"If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story \"It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!\" , then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there."
l9z88h	35	42	They aren't worth anything, so who cares!.
l9z88h	36	102	At its peak, over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month .
l9z88h	37	184	This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry since deleted, he scrubs his tweets that says when he tried to recall his lent out shares, it took his broker many weeks to locate them.
l9z88h	38	104	Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.
l9z88h	39	18	AMC Entertainment.
l9z88h	40	79	To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017.
l9z88h	41	53	AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while.
l9z88h	42	80	They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses.
l9z88h	43	93	Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.
l9z88h	44	33	Trying to hard to not lose money.
l9z88h	45	48	Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!
l9z88h	46	80	What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June July of 2019?
l9z88h	47	75	Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M from being stable around $300m .
l9z88h	48	71	The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans.
l9z88h	49	49	The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.
l9z88h	50	81	The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019.
l9z88h	51	19	What happened then?
l9z88h	52	83	AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M.
l9z88h	53	44	Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds.
l9z88h	54	19	And then COVID hit.
l9z88h	55	83	Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed.
l9z88h	56	4	Why?
l9z88h	57	250	May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that movie theaters , among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.
l9z88h	58	102	Also like GameStop, at its peak over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver .
l9z88h	59	19	This is not normal.
l9z88h	60	11	Conclusion.
l9z88h	61	223	I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid 2019.
l9z88h	62	147	They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all in for the kill when COVID hit the US.
l9z88h	63	139	It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

l9xptr	0	32	A message from a fallen soldier.
l9xptr	1	11	Hello guys.
l9xptr	2	61	I just wanted to say how blown away I am by what's happening.
l9xptr	3	167	Last year, I was heavily invested most of my portfolio, not smart I know in GNUS which ended up getting fucked by and over shorted by Citron resulting in heavy losses.
l9xptr	4	113	I was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital.
l9xptr	5	75	I was forced to pull back from trading because I couldn't sustain the loss.
l9xptr	6	100	I'm 22 with a tax bill and a business that's on hold due to covid so I can only take so many losses.
l9xptr	7	62	Another year, another opportunity for a bounce back hopefully.
l9xptr	8	199	I genuinely believed in the company and went long but then Citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad PR and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down.
l9xptr	9	152	I remember seeing teachers, firemen, and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason.
l9xptr	10	74	They tried to do the same with GameStop but you guys didn't let it happen.
l9xptr	11	69	This genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes.
l9xptr	12	220	I'm playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation, explaining what's going on, where to buy GME and why these institutions deserve the punishment they're getting.
l9xptr	13	15	It's working!!!
l9xptr	14	92	Excited to be back in the game once I hopefully get the business up and running after covid.
l9xptr	15	30	Keep strong ladies and gents 3
laqa34	0	115	GME Evidence of Short Seller Collusion for Months and an Explanation for Why Short Estimates are Probably Way Off!.
laqa34	1	44	MODS THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE.
laqa34	2	108	So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently.
laqa34	3	120	"What if I tell you that \"short interest is going down\" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?."
laqa34	4	16	Let me explain .
laqa34	5	46	Today, I saw something very strange on Webull.
laqa34	6	73	I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for $14, 20$, and around $30.
laqa34	7	168	I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again.
laqa34	8	39	The order obviously didn't get filled .
laqa34	9	29	Processing img lmjh2m5bn0f61.
laqa34	10	89	At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked!
laqa34	11	207	I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen $14, $20, $30 ! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal.
laqa34	12	67	Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.
laqa34	13	46	So why are we seeing these prices again today?
laqa34	14	16	I have a theory!
laqa34	15	106	Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following .
laqa34	16	76	Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down.
laqa34	17	159	Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them.
laqa34	18	56	A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again.
laqa34	19	62	This continues until the price gets down to the desired level.
laqa34	20	113	This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands.
laqa34	21	121	If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.
laqa34	22	162	Here is the thing these short sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created!
laqa34	23	129	"The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest \"in theory\" seems to be going down also proves this!"
laqa34	24	121	I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks!
laqa34	25	61	They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!.
laqa34	26	98	"Now you might ask \"what if all of the short interest is artificial?\", the answer is an obvious no!"
laqa34	27	15	Why do you ask?
laqa34	28	115	because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!.
laqa34	29	87	How do I know or rather guess that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot?
laqa34	30	11	2 reasons .
laqa34	31	69	1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages AFAIK .
laqa34	32	190	2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around 11.09m shares .
laqa34	33	28	Position Cost Distribution .
laqa34	34	256	As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands!
laqa34	35	273	So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by 0.159 69.75m 11.09m in the past two days unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions !.
laqa34	36	141	"What I do not know is this do these short sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of \"short selling\" or not!"
laqa34	37	38	My guess is that they don't, because .
laqa34	38	47	1. They are probably scared of getting caught!.
laqa34	39	388	2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower .
laqa34	40	101	3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!.
laqa34	41	134	"Also, note that shorts don't have to \"borrow and sell\" to each other to create a ladder, they can just \"buy and sell\" from each other."
laqa34	42	92	However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!.
laqa34	43	66	Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze!
laqa34	44	147	This also suggests that short sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!.
laqa34	45	72	Disclaimer I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice.
laqa34	46	99	This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise!
laqa34	47	48	I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.
laqa34	48	190	Hopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!
laq0jt	0	39	PLTR lock up expiration and S 1 filing.
laq0jt	1	40	Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor.
laq0jt	2	79	I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job.
laq0jt	3	68	Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.
laq0jt	4	13	Hey traders,.
laq0jt	5	177	As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner estimated 2 11 , their lock up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2
laq0jt	6	232	14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.
laq0jt	7	423	As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook , I was confused when I saw webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b Does this mean the lock up expiration will free up only 400m shares if yes, BULLISH ? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s 1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.
laq0jt	8	127	NOTE This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so PLEASE correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased.
laq0jt	9	143	I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.
laq0jt	10	12	S 1 filing .
laq0jt	11	65	As of September 1st, 2020 , this was the total number of shares .
laq0jt	12	77	Ignoring Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options .
laq0jt	13	40	On first trading day back in September .
laq0jt	14	80	383,609,647 fully diluted shares including stock options was available to trade.
laq0jt	15	66	Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade.
laq0jt	16	126	"Due to Investors' Rights Agreement, they \"expected\" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade."
laq0jt	17	98	Total Up to 1,296,763,645 fully diluted shares which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float .
laq0jt	18	42	On lock up expiration day estimated 2 14 .
laq0jt	19	62	1,863,150,291 fully diluted shares will be available to trade.
laq0jt	20	129	From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares.
laq0jt	21	42	Adjusted 949,996,293 fully diluted shares.
laq0jt	22	51	Result Total of 2,246,759,938 fully diluted shares.
laq0jt	23	58	The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully diluted shares.
laq0jt	24	94	The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.
laq0jt	25	79	So the lock up expiration doesn't free up 80% of outstanding, but instead 42% .
laq0jt	26	28	Analysis on insider selling.
laq0jt	27	64	As of June 30, 2020 , this was how the shares were distributed .
laq0jt	28	32	Source nasdaq insider activity .
laq0jt	29	55	All as of Feb 1, 2021, they sold the following shares .
laq0jt	30	26	Executives and directors .
laq0jt	31	34	Alexander Karp 10,244,631 shares .
laq0jt	32	31	Stephen Cohen 5,133,000 shares.
laq0jt	33	30	Shyam Sankar 3,068,754 shares.

laq0jt	36	26	Alexandra Schiff 0 shares.
laq0jt	37	30	Peter Thiel 27,382,866 shares.
laq0jt	38	30	David Glazer 2,261,507 shares.
laq0jt	39	28	Matthew Long 848,811 shares.
laq0jt	40	29	Ryan Taylor 1,075,892 shares.
laq0jt	41	24	TOTAL 50,318,461 shares.
laq0jt	42	53	None of the large shareholders VCs institutions sold!
laq0jt	43	52	Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list!
laq0jt	44	74	The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances.
laq0jt	45	203	But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity something Robinhood doesn't have .
laq0jt	46	135	Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out.
laq0jt	47	81	Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt .
laq0jt	48	43	What will happen on lockup expiration day?.
laq0jt	49	35	I think the following will happen .
laq0jt	50	10	will sell.
laq0jt	51	41	Some short sellers will come by for sure.
laq0jt	52	34	Insiders will obviously sell some.
laq0jt	53	56	But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that .
laq0jt	54	14	s are fearing.
laq0jt	55	17	Some key rumors .
laq0jt	56	44	Some insiders are looking to buy up shares .
laq0jt	57	13	reddit post .
laq0jt	58	58	Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years .
laq0jt	59	65	reddit post a good DD overall as well from ex Palantir engineer .
laq0jt	60	131	I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards.
laq0jt	61	44	I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip.
laq0jt	62	79	TLDR I think lock up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish .
laq0jt	63	61	Positions 200 shares of PLTR, 84 LEAPS of Jan 2022 $40 calls.
laq0jt	64	29	Obligatory PLTR TO THE MOON .
laq0jt	65	12	Edit 1 typo.
laq0jt	66	116	Edit 2 included lock up expiration date, which is third trading day from q4 2020 ER estimated 2 11 so probably 2 14?

lapp7l	6	209	My limited knowledge only lies in fundamental long term investing, so learning first hand about how market manipulation can affect everyday people and not just HFTs people I assumed are better off made me mad.
lapp7l	7	175	For these reasons and the fact that the lawsuits will take months, I feel that my itch for justice won't be scratched unless someone tells me how this will never happen again.
lapp7l	8	110	From my understanding, RH is fucked no matter what and the hedge fund managers are hopefully facing jail time.
lapp7l	9	6	Great.
lapp7l	10	96	However, I don't understand what is going to be put in place to ensure this never happens again.
lapp7l	11	130	People will just get replaced or get off virtually unscathed, so how will the government enact change to stop market manipulation?
lapp7l	12	76	In my eyes, market manipulation is the main problem or is it something else.
lapp7l	13	121	Also, will trading become more positive for retail investors or will everything be the same or worse after this is over?.
lapp7l	14	55	I just want to organize my thoughts and shape my views.
lapp7l	15	21	Thx for any feedback.

lapilj	0	58	250% clearing partner charge for GME, AMC, and NOK by DTC.
lapilj	1	114	Stake is no longer letting us buy GME, AMC, or NOK because the DTC is requiring 250% of the value of these stocks.
lapilj	2	27	This is not their decision.
lapilj	3	72	Their broker dealer cannot pay the 250% charge for trading these stocks.
lapilj	4	11	Read here .
lapilj	5	22	Snippet from article .
lapilj	6	136	The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.
lapilj	7	122	The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10 15% of the value of a security's holdings on broker's books.
lapilj	8	60	However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility.
lapilj	9	112	In the case of the above symbols, the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealth's clearing partners.
lapilj	10	105	DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase.
lapilj	11	33	We'll update you if this changes.
lapilj	12	106	This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific.
lapilj	13	251	It is calculated through a value at risk model more detail on the formula is available from page 57 here Most simply, it's a function of the riskiness of a security being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks.
lapilj	14	69	As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise.
lapilj	15	176	When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements.
lapilj	16	94	Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement.
laph8v	0	38	Dumped my 14.5k life savings into GME.

lapgyq	0	79	So some hedges have short interest, but don't hedges bet against other hedges?.
lapgyq	1	95	So I guess there's a lot of negativity about these short ladder attacks driving the price down.
lapgyq	2	57	However, I must say we are not the only players for $gme.
lapgyq	3	166	Hedges are more than willing to take other hedges out because in wall street, it is always about the survival of the fittest or in this case, survival of the richest.
lapgyq	4	128	This artificial drive down of this stock may be inversed by causing a massive spike to cause the competing firms to go bankrupt.
lapgyq	5	119	We should not be saying all hedges are out to get retail investors, but they are trying to get each other to play ball.
lapgyq	6	86	So wait for the squeeze, it will be initiated by a hedge or by short interest squeeze.
lapgyq	7	53	This $gme squeeze looks tasty as fuck for all hedges.
lapgyq	8	22	So take a chill pill .
lapgyq	9	15	or suppository.
lapgyq	10	13	We will moon.
lapgyq	11	64	Hurrrrr durrr, I like to to smell my armpits and am very stupid.
lapgyq	12	51	This is dumb speculation, so discuss as you'd like.
lapgyq	13	35	Evidence supports a squeeze thesis.
lapgyq	14	60	Depends if they force option holders to expire out of money.
lapgyq	15	74	So exercise the in the money and force the shorts to buy if holding calls.
lapcrn	0	35	How many stocks did The Viking buy?

lapcrn	3	28	If he can hold, we can hold.
laoy1b	0	26	Please read this you apes.
laoy1b	1	36	This will be longer than we thought.
laoy1b	2	37	Read these links if you aren't lazy .
laoy1b	3	67	I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions.
laoy1b	4	41	TLDR Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit.
laoy1b	5	100	"They've been illegally \"closing out\" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked."
laoy1b	6	41	There is far more nefarious shit at play.
laoy1b	7	104	So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME.
laoy1b	8	105	This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above 120% short interest still.
laoy1b	9	173	I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close 50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week.
laoy1b	10	51	This got me digging around to figure out what's up.
laoy1b	11	246	I started by looking into GME failed to delivers i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had 1.2 MILLION failed to delivers.
laoy1b	12	54	This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.
laoy1b	13	123	What was interesting though, is that of that 1.2million, 700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period.
laoy1b	14	109	I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months.
laoy1b	15	80	It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.
laoy1b	16	173	Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on.
laoy1b	17	104	To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article .
laoy1b	18	80	In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME .
laoy1b	19	23	"\"Assuming that XYZ e.g."
laoy1b	20	284	GME is a hard to borrow security e.g. apes holding strong , and that Trader A Melvin , or its broker dealer, is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A's clearing firm.
laoy1b	21	361	Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker dealer's close out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale.
laoy1b	22	156	Most often, this is done through the use of a buy write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options.
laoy1b	23	191	"These trades are commonly referred to as \"reset transactions,\" in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close out a fail."
laoy1b	24	171	The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations.
laoy1b	25	101	Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases.
laoy1b	26	178	Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm's responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.
laoy1b	27	91	It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen in combination with the ladder attacks .
laoy1b	28	115	My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.
laoy1b	29	64	I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud.
laoy1b	30	41	In fact, I would bet all my money on it .
laoy1b	31	27	oh wait, I did 96 GME 290..
laoy1b	32	54	I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.
laoy1b	33	9	More DD .
laoy1b	34	54	Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner.
laoy1b	35	75	One paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link credit to u bcRIPster .
laoy1b	36	67	"\"I don't mean the bet WSB played that Marvin had 140% of the FLOAT."
laoy1b	37	93	I mean that Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock have sold more than the TOTAL SHARES that EXIST.
laoy1b	38	71	That's a completely different problem and it's punishable by jail time.
laoy1b	39	11	Not a joke.
laoy1b	40	85	It's basically counterfeiting stock shares, although that's not the terminology used.
laoy1b	41	66	If this is true, who knows how many other times they've done this.
laoy1b	42	62	Or maybe it's not true, and they just really like the stock???
laoy1b	43	164	If BlackRock started buying five days ago, and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days, then the doomsday clock doesn't run out until at least February 17th.
laoy1b	44	96	If Wall Street can get WSB to sell before then, then they won't get caught and won't go to jail.
laoy1b	45	19	But if they don't .
laoy1b	46	50	well, this will make Enron look like chump change.
laoy1b	47	158	If enough people hold until the end of February, and this is truly the situation, then there is a chance that major parts of Wall Street are going to IMPLODE.
laoy1b	48	16	The Conclusion .
laoy1b	49	124	Apes need diamond hands until the end of February in order to get the SEC involved, most likely somewhere between Feb 17th .
laoy1b	50	5	19th.
laoy1b	51	94	"Whether or not this will happen is anybody's guess, but if it does all heck may break loose!\"."
laoy1b	52	11	My opinion?
laoy1b	53	183	This, along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring March 19th that we're just bought see the front page of WSB means that this may not end for a few weeks, maybe even longer.
laoy1b	54	61	The only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are HELD.
laoy1b	55	27	Are we going to do this????
laoy1b	56	34	Or are we going to paper hand out?
laoy1b	57	47	If we're commuting to this shit let's do it!!!!
laoy1b	58	65	If you're gonna paper hand eventually we don't want you, get out.
laoy1b	59	48	It just makes it worse the later you paper hand.
laoy1b	60	121	Someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are.
laoy1b	61	6	TLDR .
laoy1b	62	148	If these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes, you may have to hold up until end of February or even longer.
laoy1b	63	27	But this shit is happening.
laoy1b	64	63	ALSO dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out.
laoy1b	65	25	This is REALLY important.
laoy1b	66	110	Take a walk, workout, read, watch TV, spend some time with family take some breaks from staring at the ticker.
laoy1b	67	98	It may not do much other than be manipulated lower, rise slightly, and be stable in the near term.
laoy1b	68	98	But this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled.
laoy1b	69	60	I own GME, like the stock, and this is not financial advice.
laoy1b	70	63	It's merely a suggestion, and trying to help people learn more.
laoy1b	71	39	Nothing more, you can do as you choose.

laofb7	0	28	IMO SQUEEZE IS STILL COMING.
laofb7	1	17	And they know it.
laofb7	2	50	They're using both sides to minimize total losses.
laofb7	3	58	"Covering short positions during these \"manufactured\" dips."
laofb7	4	66	And then planning to make additional $ on these $800 call options.
laofb7	5	65	Thus, minimizing their total losses once we leave the atmosphere.
laofb7	6	94	Could be a combination of the following, but either way I think the SQUEEZE is still imminent.
laofb7	7	57	We're just witnessing them minimizing their total losses.
laofb7	8	11	Here's how.
laofb7	9	116	"The dip today possibly a few more days is giving the Shorts a chance to exit \"some positions\" on a manufactured dip."
laofb7	10	89	Perhaps, saving them from being closed out of some spots BEFORE the price heads towards .
laofb7	11	86	However, there just isn't enough volume for them to really cut significant all losses.
laofb7	12	66	Because most continue to hold not intimated by the ladder attacks.
laofb7	13	68	Next up, we have a significant amount of $800 calls being purchased.
laofb7	14	142	where they intend to profit by purchasing out of the money call options, paying a relatively low premium for a chance of a much larger payoff.
laofb7	15	9	IF WHEN .
laofb7	16	48	Just my interpretation of the current situation.
laofb7	17	131	AND most important of all, requires all the current stock holders to stay the course and not sell until possible SQUEEZE is SQUOZE.
laofb7	18	42	Not a financial advisor, just a dumb dumb.

lao9zo	0	26	The SEC is mostly USELESS.
lao9zo	1	147	Aside from the occasional Martha Stewart, the SEC routinely fails to investigate and act on the naked short selling activities of large hedgefunds.
lao9zo	2	35	They failed to act on Bear Stearns.
lao9zo	3	68	They failed to act on Bernie Madoff EVEN after they were tipped off.
lao9zo	4	61	Instead, it was Palantir's software that tipped off the SIPC.
lao9zo	5	83	The SEC is unlikely to act in favor of the retail investors because of one reason .
lao9zo	6	115	These employees have a good shot at retiring from the government to an executive position at these very hedgefunds.
lao9zo	7	96	These current employees are incentivized to not act against the hedgefunds during their careers.

lanzkz	0	138	Similar to what brokers claimed to be the problem last week, hedge funds closing their shorts will have an enormous liquidity problem too.
lanzkz	1	90	TL DR there is only so much money hedge funds can cover their shorts, don't be TOO greedy.
lanzkz	2	70	Some people are calling for GME to hit 10,000 or 50,000 at some point.
lanzkz	3	111	If GME hits 10,000 that's 700 Billion dollars tied into the market cap 10,000 share price x 70 million shares .
lanzkz	4	82	If it hits 50,000 that's 3.5 trillion dollars 50,000 a share x 70 million shares .
lanzkz	5	106	To be clear it seems that retail investors own 100% of GME, and some how hedge funds also own 130% of GME.
lanzkz	6	76	So at 10,000 50,000 levels, retail investors would have between 300 billion.
lanzkz	7	79	1.2 trillion, and somehow hedge funds would have to cover between 400 billion .
lanzkz	8	35	2.3 trillion to close their shorts.
lanzkz	9	127	These numbers do not compute with being able to be paid off by shorts covering, because hedge funds don't have THAT much money.
lanzkz	10	74	Both stimulus bills combined are just shy of the market cap of GME 50,000.
lanzkz	11	39	Just saying be realistic on price guys.
lanzkz	12	108	At GME 1,000 that's 70 billion tied into the market cap, and that MIGHT be possible for the shorts to cover.
lanzkz	13	45	Melvin capital is down 50% this year on what?
lanzkz	14	25	A 15 billion dollar loss?
lanzkz	15	103	Even if they lose ALL their money at GME 1,000 we still need to find 5 billion to short cover the rest.
lanzkz	16	69	AND that's only 100% of the float, they have apparently shorted 130%.
lanzkz	17	111	Sure MAYBE they could cover at GME 2,500, beyond that there would be liquidity problems and bankruptcy filings.
lanzkz	18	70	Maybe I'm just totally out of touch and ranting at a wall here though.

lan5ct	6	120	"After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever \"Meatless Meat Comparison Chart\" or MMCC."
lan5ct	7	149	As you can see from the results, he found that there is a 87.5% match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger.

lamwg6	3	19	Moving right along.
lamwg6	4	12	The Shorts .
lamwg6	5	15	The Side Show .
lamwg6	6	78	Let's be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts.
lamwg6	7	74	BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.
lamwg6	8	35	Fist the shorts and hold the gains.
lamwg6	9	234	Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership currently reported at 71% Biocryst has a float of 175m 124m of which are held by institutions , who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.
lamwg6	10	32	This leaves 56m tradable shares.
lamwg6	11	56	The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.
lamwg6	12	74	This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u DeepFuckingValue.
lamwg6	13	82	But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value.
lamwg6	14	85	Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock check the charts .
lamwg6	15	59	We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.
lamwg6	16	8	Rating .
lamwg6	17	5	10. .
lamwg6	18	10	Orladeyo .
lamwg6	19	13	The Prelude .
lamwg6	20	123	Orladeyo has recently been approved in the US and Japan to treat Hereditary Angioedema European approval expected shortly .
lamwg6	21	125	HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1 50,000 people, or about 25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.
lamwg6	22	74	Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive.
lamwg6	23	88	It costs $485,000 year in the US and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU.
lamwg6	24	191	The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market page 15 Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of $70 when trading at a reasonable if not conservative 7x revenue multiple.
lamwg6	25	106	Work your own numbers and you'll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion.
lamwg6	26	160	FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding commercial biotech now engaged in execution.

lamwg6	30	16	The Main Event .
lamwg6	31	28	Factor D is the blockbuster.
lamwg6	32	10	Full stop.
lamwg6	33	102	The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug.
lamwg6	34	135	"They're small targets like \"Lupus\" and \"IGA Nephropathy\" along with 6 others page 24 and it's already being hailed as \"best in class\" ."
lamwg6	35	36	So what's this look like money wise?
lamwg6	36	112	Alexion's drugs SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS are the current treatment for PNH those make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.
lamwg6	37	52	AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.
lamwg6	38	80	If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.
lamwg6	39	54	The sky is truly the limit over the next 24 48 months.
lamwg6	40	101	The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

lamwg6	46	20	Huge Ebola outbreak?

lamwg6	48	109	Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes?
lamwg6	49	11	No problem.
lamwg6	50	68	Just distribute the galidesivir and most everyone will be protected.
lamwg6	51	111	Animal studies suggest high protection against Zika Yellow Fever, Marburg, Tick Borne Encephalitis and others .
lamwg6	52	37	Why didn't we already have this drug?
lamwg6	53	74	That's anyone's guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.
lamwg6	54	119	No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts.
lamwg6	55	143	The company has already stated that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this.
lamwg6	56	48	So, we'll just call this the sleeping wild card.

lamwg6	62	61	Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age
lamwg6	63	91	11. Can't tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small.

lamwg6	66	17	The Competition .
lamwg6	67	18	The Class Clowns .
lamwg6	68	35	Disease Hereditary Angioedema HAE .
lamwg6	69	147	For the prophylactic preventative market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro from Takeda which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively.
lamwg6	70	58	Haegarda CSL Behring has a subcutaneous injection as well.
lamwg6	71	101	Orladeyo recently received FDA approval to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.
lamwg6	72	101	The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032.
lamwg6	73	260	Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until 2037 Royalty Pharma did a deep dive on BioCryst's expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.
lamwg6	74	49	Disease Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria PNH .
lamwg6	75	123	Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris both IVF C5 inhibitors to treat the rare blood disorder PNH.
lamwg6	76	54	Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris.
lamwg6	77	131	This activist letter this article highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement.
lamwg6	78	132	If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B.
lamwg6	79	9	Excited?.
lamwg6	80	73	Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it.
lamwg6	81	169	"BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors \"obsolete\" as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors."
lamwg6	82	78	Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill and a monotherapy.
lamwg6	83	45	In other words, there's not much competition.
lamwg6	84	86	Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.
lamwg6	85	14	The Insiders .
lamwg6	86	20	Still not convinced?
lamwg6	87	49	CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020.
lamwg6	88	107	Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.
lamwg6	89	81	As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes.
lamwg6	90	131	Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders.
lamwg6	91	144	Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, as recently as a couple weeks ago .

lamwg6	95	69	BCRX researched small molecules and crystalline structures for years.
lamwg6	96	140	If that's opaque, the easier way to think of it is they first developed an engine and are now in execution and placing the engine into cars.

lamwg6	98	207	If your interest is perking, you'll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse promised listen to question and answer section there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023.

lamwg6	103	19	Positions GME, BCRX
lamvr2	0	9	NNDM EGM.
lamvr2	1	33	Can somebody help me understand?.
lamvr2	2	225	"Following the approval of the Company's Board of Directors, the shareholders of the Company are requested to approve an increase to the Company's authorized share capital by NIS 1,250,000,000 the \"Increase of Share Capital\" ."
lamvr2	3	203	Accordingly, after giving effect to the Increase of Share Capital, the authorized share capital of the Company will be NIS 2,500,000,000 divided into 500,000,000 Ordinary Shares, par value NIS 5.00 each.
lamvr2	4	257	Following the Company's most recent registered direct offering of 35,000,000 Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs that closed on January 19, 2021, the Company only has approximately 18,000,000 Ordinary Shares available for issuance on a fully diluted basis .
lamvr2	5	240	The Board of Directors believes that Increase of Share Capital is appropriate and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders, especially considering that the Company is in the process of evaluating certain acquisition opportunities.
lamvr2	6	81	The shareholders of the Company are requested to adopt the following resolution .
lamvr2	7	291	"\"RESOLVED, to approve the Increase of Share Capital by NIS 1,250,000,000, to NIS 2,500,000,000, divided into 500,000,000 Ordinary Shares, par value NIS 5.00 each, and to amend the Company's amended and restated articles of association to effect the same, as set forth in the Proxy Statement."
lamvr2	8	260	I'm as much of a smooth brain as the rest of you if not more but if i'm reading this right doesn't this mean they want to increase the share capital by NIS1.25b to NIS2.5b so that the total float of the company will be 500m which NNDM values at 5NIS per share?
lamvr2	9	88	Doesn't this mean the company currently trading at USD13 would be massively over valued?
lamrle	0	12	$GME THEORY.

lamrle	2	60	However they are given 2 trading days to do that Wednesday .
lamrle	3	195	Ever thought that the reason Monday and Possibly Tuesday will be red is actually the big companies forcing with all their power to lower the price and exit with minimal loss when Wednesday comes?
lamrle	4	104	And then when they close out the Short Float being EXTEMELY LOW will cause the stock to rocket up again.

lamg0y	8	112	There was a great post re the company's product line up here make sure to check that out if you haven't already.
lamg0y	9	62	My approach is to look at $BB from a strategic financial lens.
lamg0y	10	54	First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp.
lamg0y	11	136	w a company like BB where one time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady state earnings.
lamg0y	12	89	So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings.
lamg0y	13	55	Basically How does the market value similar businesses?
lamg0y	14	42	No shit BB is not a phone company anymore.
lamg0y	15	85	They are, if you've been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company.
lamg0y	16	28	What is endpoint protection?
lamg0y	17	339	Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.
lamg0y	18	131	Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges.
lamg0y	19	23	So what does this mean?
lamg0y	20	176	It means we can take a look at other endpoint protection digital security companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.
lamg0y	21	25	See below a quick spread.
lamg0y	22	132	Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of at least $60 share.
lamg0y	23	51	And this is only if it is the average of its peers.
lamg0y	24	75	I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.
lamg0y	25	99	Long story short Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth.
lamg0y	26	57	IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY .
lamg0y	27	95	A FUTURE FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS E.G.
lamg0y	28	94	"MOBILITY TRANSPORT , ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE \"COMPARABLES\" ARE TRADING."
lamg0y	29	124	In other words, the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit lack of public understanding of its current business .
lamg0y	30	89	In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit .

lamg0y	33	34	Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!.
lamg0y	34	90	No matter how good or bad the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon.
lamg0y	35	198	So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks.
lamg0y	36	119	You also saw the post on reflexivity basically, stonks up can make company good, not just company good make stonks up .
lamg0y	37	18	The best part is .
lamg0y	38	61	even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop.

lamg0y	42	130	"YOu don't have to try to \"time the top\" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals non technical reasons supporting the stock."

lam364	0	5	IFF .
lam364	1	48	Updated Due Diligence And Potential HUGE Upside.
lam364	2	13	Hey you guys!
lam364	3	6	Sloth.
lam364	4	90	Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF.
lam364	5	156	TLDR Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze Gamma squeeze at $150 and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.
lam364	6	49	Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume.
lam364	7	116	Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder started at 2 50pm .
lam364	8	82	There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.
lam364	9	112	The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now.
lam364	10	85	And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open.
lam364	11	114	Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.
lam364	12	117	Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150..
lam364	13	64	So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares.
lam364	14	70	I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though.
lam364	15	98	This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150..
lam364	16	38	Yes,of course I have positions on IFF.
lam364	17	85	And no, this isn't investment advice, just a recommendation to check it out yourself.

lalnju	0	61	Let's talk about the GME $800 Calls for 2 5, 2 12, 2 19 and 3
lalnju	1	24	19. Okay fellow retards.
lalnju	2	106	time for some DD on the metric fuckton of GME $800 call options for the above referenced expiration dates.
lalnju	3	73	Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal.
lalnju	4	91	I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3 19 $800 call options and the significant volume.
lalnju	5	83	I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what might be going on.
lalnju	6	67	Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed.
lalnju	7	29	Let's start with the numbers.
lalnju	8	95	there were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations.
lalnju	9	171	This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday .
lalnju	10	77	Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or decreases.
lalnju	11	195	this will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them have to be opening new contracts since the volume is 3x the OI.
lalnju	12	12	Proof below.
lalnju	13	20	GME 2 5 $800 Calls .
lalnju	14	21	GME 2 12 $800 Calls .
lalnju	15	21	GME 2 19 $800 Calls .
lalnju	16	21	GME 3 19 $800 Calls .
lalnju	17	90	Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations?
lalnju	18	194	There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and or most reasonable explanation.
lalnju	19	98	My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO.
lalnju	20	86	If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is $57M.
lalnju	21	147	also note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so.
lalnju	22	83	They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate.
lalnju	23	91	Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?.
lalnju	24	62	I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these naked.
lalnju	25	63	could they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME?
lalnju	26	71	Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks.
lalnju	27	91	It also exposes the seller to massive risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM.
lalnju	28	81	It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the money.
lalnju	29	86	we know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.
lalnju	30	160	I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.
lalnju	31	75	If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why?
lalnju	32	5	Well.
lalnju	33	69	$57M isn't that much when you're down billions so far on your shorts.
lalnju	34	279	If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery, and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2 very important things could be achieved
lalnju	35	124	1. They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and
lalnju	36	97	2. they can recognize significant profit hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up.
lalnju	37	207	The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media to get their ducks in a row.
lalnju	38	78	They are trying to engineer the squeeze on their terms to reduce their losses.
lalnju	39	68	TLDR There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes.
lalnju	40	32	Seems weird for them to be sold.
lalnju	41	210	Might be HF's plan to profit hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.

lalg87	1	91	XL Fleet short interest increased from 50% to 72% in the latest reporting came out Friday .
lalg87	2	128	$XL Fleet only has 8.25M shares of public float Of that, 8.6% are institutionally owned i.e. not going to be sold anytime soon .
lalg87	3	65	That means there are roughly 7.6M shares of true float available.
lalg87	4	160	At 7.6M shares, it only takes 76,000 call option contracts that are in the money the strike is less below the current trading price to lock up the ENTIRE FLOAT.
lalg87	5	91	Notice how the OI spikes MASSIVELY on the C25 and C30, with a decent bit at C20 and C22.5 .
lalg87	6	64	There are already nearly 40,000 contracts that are In The Money.

lakbx2	0	27	Why $VALE Vale SA is a buy.
lakbx2	1	58	$VALE is a mining company one of the largest in the world.
lakbx2	2	72	They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper.
lakbx2	3	66	It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.
lakbx2	4	40	20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy.
lakbx2	5	33	80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy.
lakbx2	6	49	However, the price targets are not the high, why?
lakbx2	7	146	They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.
lakbx2	8	184	$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production.
lakbx2	9	107	The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.
lakbx2	10	34	So why the huge upside potential?.
lakbx2	11	21	One Answer Papa Elon.
lakbx2	12	105	Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement.
lakbx2	13	122	I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract.
lakbx2	14	291	If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80 $100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030..
lakbx2	15	26	Let me know your thoughts.
lakbx2	16	51	Do you think I am right or just a retard redditor?.
lakbx2	17	120	Edit I have also seen a large order volume for 2 19 21C if that is any indicator of anything, perhaps insider knowledge.

lail27	1	15	Hello Everyone.
lail27	2	120	I know short squeezes have been a hot topic in the recent weeks by I think I may have stumbled upon another opportunity.
lail27	3	78	According to FinViz, $TLRY has a 50% short interest currently and a 30M float.
lail27	4	154	This is very interesting to me since $TLRY has been the beneficiary of a short squeeze in the past and has had relatively good press in the past few days.
lail27	5	13	Linked below.
lail27	6	48	TLDR Exclusivity to sell medical MJ in Portugal.

lail27	9	95	Senate majority leader setting legalization of MJ as a priority for this secession of congress.
lail27	10	72	On the technical side, $TLRY has been improving all its bottom q q even.
lail27	11	16	See image below.
lail27	12	155	As you can see, revenue has increased, cost of revenue decreased, gross profit increased and finally net income increased significantly since last quarter.
lail27	13	103	With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q q which is a great sign for investors.
lail27	14	123	With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here.
lail27	15	78	Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.
lail27	16	87	TLDR $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets.
lail27	17	97	With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.

laifyg	0	68	How hedge funds can close position without affecting the GME volume.
laifyg	1	135	So I am a smooth brain retard who doesn't know much but I was curious as to how can short interest decrease when the volume was so low.
laifyg	2	185	Turns out Wall Street has a technique called ETF Stripping, where they can buy ETFs with significant allocation to GME, 'strip' GME stocks and use those shares to close their positions.
laifyg	3	42	You can find more info from this article .
laifyg	4	37	PS As I mentioned I am not an expert.
laifyg	5	123	I will urge industry experts to correct me if I am wrong or expand this post by adding more context in the comment section.
laifeq	0	19	FAILURE TO DELIVER.
laifeq	1	216	Fails to Deliver The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares.
laifeq	2	74	Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked.
laifeq	3	69	For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days.
laifeq	4	172	According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market.
laifeq	5	158	"This is called a \"buy in,\" and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued."
laifeq	6	154	Market makers have special exemptions from the rules they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to 21 trading days before they have to borrow a share.
laifeq	7	166	When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail to deliver of the borrowed share .
laifeq	8	77	Trading amongst themselves short ladder attacks will reset that 21 day timer.
laifeq	9	41	They can keep rolling counterfeit shares.

lai275	0	44	Technical Analysis of GME and Reality Check.
lai275	1	87	Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor, and nor am I writing this as financial advice.
lai275	2	85	This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME.
lai275	3	37	Many of you will hate my perspective.
lai275	4	137	You will call me a insert rainbow bear emoji I am write these on word so yeah , you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud.
lai275	5	210	But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into.
lai275	6	95	And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective.
lai275	7	57	I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub.
lai275	8	110	This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter.
lai275	9	106	However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn.
lai275	10	95	And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of.
lai275	11	83	However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS.
lai275	12	49	Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so.
lai275	13	111	This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading.
lai275	14	91	I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you.
lai275	15	116	And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money.
lai275	16	122	"There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you \"Ride the trade, until it doesn't make sense anymore\"."
lai275	17	102	And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point.
lai275	18	109	So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend.
lai275	19	65	This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations.
lai275	20	118	I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts Technical Analysis .
lai275	21	73	My Technical Analysis approach I am an intermediate term momentum trader.
lai275	22	67	This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5 15 days.
lai275	23	35	The tools I use are the following .
lai275	24	74	RSI Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.
lai275	25	176	MACD This is trend following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock.
lai275	26	25	Volume Speaks for itself.
lai275	27	115	MVWAP & SMA Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter term trend.
lai275	28	32	MVWAP Pink Line, SMA Teal Line .
lai275	29	110	I usually use a mix of the 15 & 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.
lai275	30	97	Chart A Below you will find the 15 minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading.
lai275	31	58	Each data point represents a 15 minute segment of trading.
lai275	32	123	The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre market and after hours trading.
lai275	33	29	Chart A 15 minute intervals .
lai275	34	120	Tuesday of Chart A shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours.
lai275	35	238	This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions .
lai275	36	84	Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart Bulllish .
lai275	37	107	The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well Bullish .
lai275	38	126	"And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day \"Green\"."
lai275	39	110	However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after.
lai275	40	149	Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session.
lai275	41	144	Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes.
lai275	42	62	Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security.
lai275	43	238	Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur 1 the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2 MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3 The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well.
lai275	44	75	To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well.
lai275	45	34	Chart B 1 Hour Trading Intervals .
lai275	46	126	As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term 1 hour Chart .
lai275	47	165	Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period 1 hour intervals , and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading.
lai275	48	120	At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence.
lai275	49	87	"That the RSI has neared \"oversold\" territory anything below 30 is considered oversold ."
lai275	50	96	And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.
lai275	51	76	"As I said earlier, \"You ride the trade until it doesn't make sense anymore\"."
lai275	52	98	And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside.
lai275	53	152	Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security.
lai275	54	82	Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time.
lai275	55	18	I hope I am wrong.
lai275	56	69	I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon.
lai275	57	85	I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma Ramp.
lai275	58	62	But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.
lai275	59	87	Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive.
lai275	60	91	But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture.
lai275	61	19	Be a fucking robot.
lai275	62	76	For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim.
lai275	63	66	Positions No Calls left in the hopper, only shares about 1500 $19.
lai25w	0	54	We had to take action email blast from Robin YourHood.
lai25w	1	22	A note from Robinhood.
lai25w	2	14	Hi CxXxXXxXx,.
lai25w	3	168	"We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking \"Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?\" ."
lai25w	4	176	We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing.
lai25w	5	104	We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.
lai25w	6	147	To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below .
lai25w	7	101	For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
lai25w	8	86	Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm's customers hold.
lai25w	9	131	If a firm's customers' holdings are volatile, a broker in this instance Robinhood is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
lai25w	10	107	Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood's deposit requirements rose tenfold.
lai25w	11	196	The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.
lai25w	12	122	We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations.
lai25w	13	101	We didn't want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren't trying to help hedge funds.
lai25w	14	103	We hope you take away this at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets.
lai25w	15	104	Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment.
lai25w	16	95	We'll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.
lai25w	17	54	Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.
lai25w	18	11	Sincerely,.

lah1uf	1	39	My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry.
lah1uf	2	61	I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB.
lah1uf	3	108	I decided to double check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place.
lah1uf	4	118	From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.
lah1uf	5	73	Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy in of $17,62 per stock.
lah1uf	6	186	Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that this is in no way financal advice , neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text.
lah1uf	7	36	I'm just your average happy amateur.
lah1uf	8	59	THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY .
lah1uf	9	83	For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore.
lah1uf	10	60	They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT.
lah1uf	11	170	Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX remember that last one, because it's important .
lah1uf	12	174	In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government.
lah1uf	13	222	The US agencies in question that got attacked were parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.
lah1uf	14	75	However, not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack .
lah1uf	15	16	BLACKBERRY QNX .
lah1uf	16	163	Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real time operating system meaning that it can process data without buffer delays .
lah1uf	17	101	If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.
lah1uf	18	26	Read more about QNX here .
lah1uf	19	66	PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP EV INDUSTRY IN CHINA .
lah1uf	20	108	Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle market in China.
lah1uf	21	96	You might have heard about some of their most successful brands NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.
lah1uf	22	163	NIO has a market cap of $61.6 bn , XPENG has a market cap of $31.5 bn , Baidu has a market cap of $80,16 , and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping $114,7 bn .
lah1uf	23	33	Why is this good for Blackberry?.
lah1uf	24	114	"1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be \"powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng\" using."
lah1uf	25	15	you guessed it!
lah1uf	26	4	QNX!
lah1uf	27	148	2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars.
lah1uf	28	141	"I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that \"Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology\" using."
lah1uf	29	15	you guessed it!
lah1uf	30	4	QNX!
lah1uf	31	145	"3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO the other EV maker has had a joint venture in the form of the brand \"Hycan\", an electric car manufacturer."
lah1uf	32	102	It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.
lah1uf	33	16	Read more here .
lah1uf	34	25	PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON .
lah1uf	35	102	As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e commerce and cloud platform company.
lah1uf	36	172	BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services AWS to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.
lah1uf	37	38	AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015.
lah1uf	38	192	At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars.
lah1uf	39	173	AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.
lah1uf	40	307	By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over the air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits, advanced driver assistance systems ADAS , and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud based apps.
lah1uf	41	173	This reinforces BlackBerry's market dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV market.
lah1uf	42	16	PROJECT KUIPER .
lah1uf	43	76	I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.
lah1uf	44	188	From Wikipedia Kuiper Systems LLC is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity.
lah1uf	45	74	"The deployment is also referred to by its project name \" Project Kuiper \"."
lah1uf	46	119	Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.
lah1uf	47	34	How could BB fit into this thing?.
lah1uf	48	28	Well, here's my hypothesis .
lah1uf	49	63	Why would Amazon start a long term partnership with BlackBerry?
lah1uf	50	77	Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in house of course.
lah1uf	51	141	If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?.
lah1uf	52	149	"Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way \"out there\"."
lah1uf	53	67	I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!.
lah1uf	54	7	TL DR .
lah1uf	55	121	BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV manufacturers.
lah1uf	56	49	BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper

lb078k	1	6	Guys .
lb078k	2	30	the squeeze has come and gone.
lb078k	3	126	This is the end game now, you all just need to bail and take what you can off the table before it goes to 10 and then to zero.
lb078k	4	205	I know you don't believe data etc and your bias wants you to believe the short interest stats are all nonsense, but when all available short interest indicators have collapsed after a meteoric price rise .
lb078k	5	9	its over.
lb078k	6	10	see below.
lb078k	7	108	The remaininng short interest is easy to cover, and there's no reason to believe you can squeeze it higher .
lb078k	8	97	your powder is probably mostly shot seriously, how many of you have anything left in the chamber?

layi0z	0	15	Not Surprising.
layi0z	1	151	It's not surprising that both $GME and $AMC are dipping so much when they have cut off the ability for common, small buy people to purchase the stocks.
layi0z	2	78	Only being able to sell is scaring people and falsely pushing the market down.
layi0z	3	80	Plus I'm sure none of the HF are selling off to try and make it look even worse.
layi0z	4	6	HOLD!!
layhvf	0	54	I have cash in my account but Schwab won't let me buy.

layhvf	3	103	"\"Oh I'm sorry, looks like you're too poor to be playing our game, gonna have to STOP YOUR DAY TRADING?!"
layhvf	4	103	Absolutely pathetic that this is a rule and it shows how hard rich people don't want plebeians to rise.
layhvf	5	237	I closed with about $50 profit yesterday with about 500 in the account, at some point the profit was $100 and today I was ready to monitor all day and buy dips until suddenly my buying power is locked at $0.00 even though I have $401.07.
layhvf	6	24	How is that fair at all?
layhvf	7	107	This shits pissing me off, is there any way to get around this or does pdt stick with my name or something?
layhvf	8	6	Thanks

layfj4	0	49	From Wendy's to Tendies A Story of how I got my .
layfj4	1	95	"I never really make \"story time\" posts like this, but it feels appropriate and cathartic today."
layfj4	2	168	Once upon a time I made over a million dollars from a very early investment off a Wendy's paycheck into fairly well known digital currency automod preventing the name .
layfj4	3	59	No, that's not where the money came from in my other posts.
layfj4	4	32	I lost that million, completely.
layfj4	5	41	I was wallstreetbets before this existed.
layfj4	6	68	I literally found out and learned about said currency from 4chan b .
layfj4	7	89	I lost it because when it peaked and fell, I sold for other currencies , then those fell.
layfj4	8	22	I didn't trust my gut.
layfj4	9	55	If I held I would have multi millions by today's price.
layfj4	10	10	That said.
layfj4	11	18	I didn't have my .
layfj4	12	4	yet.
layfj4	13	66	I got into GME because of extensive research throughout last year.
layfj4	14	46	I bought in and kept averaging since November.
layfj4	15	108	I liked Michael Burry's viewpoint, I like Ryan Cohen and believe he can do big things and I love games tech.
layfj4	16	29	Basically, I like this stock!
layfj4	17	77	I never once viewed this stock as a short squeeze play or anything like that.
layfj4	18	142	Being overly shorted was what made me confident I had a good entry point in a future value company, something the public had not yet accepted.
layfj4	19	50	People still thought it was brick and mortar only.
layfj4	20	28	That said, Something smells.
layfj4	21	119	There is plenty of DD on this sub and others, so I really don't need to restate things, but I'll briefly break it down.
layfj4	22	30	The numbers here don't add up.
layfj4	23	38	The volume and price don't make sense.
layfj4	24	42	The story is still wrong brick and mortar.
layfj4	25	30	how can they push this still .
layfj4	26	46	The media lies silver being pushed by reddit .
layfj4	27	52	I really have no true clue what the outcome will be.
layfj4	28	84	Everyone at this time is hoping for a short squeeze, and maybe it will come to that.
layfj4	29	87	I hope it does, that will be pretty fun to watch and maybe I'll get to be in the movie.
layfj4	30	113	But if it doesn't, do some other kinds of research, you might find that GME has a future outside of being a meme.
layfj4	31	40	Quite frankly it's NOT a meme, even now.
layfj4	32	46	So I knew I could do this, I knew I found my .
layfj4	33	69	Stay strong, you might have a smooth brain but you have a strong gut!
layfj4	34	47	Believe in your gut and follow your conviction.
layfj4	35	59	Lastly a quote I read last year that feels appropriate now.
layfj4	36	63	"\"Don't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up."
layfj4	37	3	"\" ."
layfj4	38	14	Robert Frost .
layfj4	39	105	WSB took a fence down and maybe, just maybe, we are starting to see why it was put up in the first place.

layl8p	3	46	Obligatory I'm holding my GME and not selling.
layl8p	4	49	I know little about stock, less than many of you.
layl8p	5	60	I have GME and AMC, but I want to learn how to stock market.
layl8p	6	54	Let's step out of the war on wall street for a minute.
layl8p	7	59	1. The general rule of thumb is buy low, sell high, right?.
layl8p	8	23	2. AMC is dipping hard.
layl8p	9	63	I don't want to sell my GME, but I want to experiment with AMC.
layl8p	10	78	We all know the dip is fake, so does anyone know when the stocks rise back up?
layl8p	11	94	I want to be able to turn my 4 stocks of AMC I don't have much to invest, stfu into 8 or more.
layl8p	12	111	Does the stock rise in after hours, or do we need to wait for another wave of people to buy AMC for it to rise?
layl7q	0	19	Where to buy now??.

layl2c	3	128	If you are thinking about selling due to feeling scared about the price drop, then you have taken the bait from the hedge funds.
layl2c	4	44	Selling helps the hedge funds and screws us.
layl2c	5	71	We are all monkeys together, we need to all buy and hold so we can win.
layl2c	6	77	My portfolio is down 52% and I am going to hold my GME shares no matter what.

laykir	1	16	But I'm holding.
layk95	0	59	My favorite paragraph from the Mark Cuban AMA this morning.
layk95	1	71	In response to someone asking why the stocks are falling this morning .
layk95	2	106	Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled .
layk95	3	102	When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.
layk95	4	30	They created a RobinHood Dive.
layk95	5	61	No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers.
layk95	6	51	And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.
layk95	7	78	Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.
layk95	8	114	Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.
layk95	9	42	When that margin call happens, its brutal.
layk95	10	111	They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low.
layk95	11	53	They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.
layk95	12	34	That then accelerates the selling.
layk95	13	86	Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular.
layk95	14	16	So what to do ?.
layk95	15	46	If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.
layk95	16	41	I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
layk95	17	122	Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.
layk95	18	41	That is when you get to make it all work.
layk95	19	135	I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
layk95	20	130	I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.
layk95	21	45	The only question is what broker do you use .
layk95	22	222	Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.

layj16	0	27	I'll Die On This Hill GME .
layj16	1	82	In 2008 my dad lost his job, he lost his retirement, and damn near lost his house.
layj16	2	58	I was 18 when that happened and it tore me up to watch it.
layj16	3	84	By now we all know the story of the excessive risk taking and the bailouts of banks.
layj16	4	40	There's never any consequences for them.
layj16	5	80	I still feel the anger when I think of the pain we went through for their greed.
layj16	6	51	This whole GME boondoggle has a similar ring to it.
layj16	7	217	Large fund tries to short a company into the ground, selling more shares than are in existence with hopes that they bust the company and no one ever finds out how many of those shares were real and how many were fake.
layj16	8	53	DFV and WSB picks up on it and what does the fund do?
layj16	9	48	They double fucking down excessive risk taking .
layj16	10	4	Why?
layj16	11	37	Because they need GME to go bankrupt.
layj16	12	55	Never mind the lives ruined by demolishing the company.
layj16	13	155	The company in this scenario is GME but this tactic is used across the board on a daily basis with no regard to the effect they're having on peoples lives.
layj16	14	39	I don't care if my position goes to $0.
layj16	15	62	I'm in this to keep this in the headlines and to drive change.
layj16	16	51	SEC needs to start looking at selling shares naked.
layj16	17	94	SEC needs to put regulations on swapping failed to deliver shares resting the clock for funds.
layj16	18	68	SEC needs to investigate why we weren't allowed to trade this stock.
layj16	19	25	84 shares of GME at $118.

layj16	21	40	Hold the fucking line, ignore the price.

layigl	0	26	What's up with AMC today?.

lb452f	0	45	I yolo'd the rest of my IRA to buy cheap GME.
lb43n2	0	48	I am down on my AMC and NOK, still hold right?!.
lb3y0v	0	87	The reality of the GME situation is that we don't know for sure what's going to happen.
lb3y0v	1	104	The people who are saying that it's definitely going to zero are acting on just as much hopium dreadium?
lb3y0v	2	38	as those saying it's going to $10,000.
lb3y0v	3	21	NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
lb3y0v	4	44	SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.
lb3y0v	5	250	Alright guys and gals, I know that the very essence of this sub is meant for circlejerking the massive gains and losses that only the truest gambling addicts geniuses of the stock market have cooked up over time, but most of you need a reality check.
lb3y0v	6	21	Calm down, gay bears.
lb3y0v	7	26	I'm talking about you too.
lb3y0v	8	58	Put your bear dicks back in your bear pants and listen up.
lb3y0v	9	88	Here's the reality of the situation nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out .
lb3y0v	10	215	Unless we've got some Ms. Cleo ass motherfucker out there with tomorrow's lottery numbers and the Superbowl results in the palm of their hand, there's not one person who can definitively say how this is going to go.
lb3y0v	11	90	When you jump on here looking for reassurance of your position, you're going to find that.
lb3y0v	12	30	It's called confirmation bias.
lb3y0v	13	61	If you think GME is going to the moon still, you'll see that.
lb3y0v	14	160	If you think GME stock is about to be sold next to the discount toilet paper and $1 pregnancy tests at the local Dollar Tree, then you're going to see that too.
lb3y0v	15	121	I probably don't need to tell you that you shouldn't have spent your life savings to buy into a meme stonk at its height.
lb3y0v	16	42	That's just some free general life advice.
lb3y0v	17	126	Since you're reading this, though, let's assume that you did, and you're currently trying to decide between $ROPE and $BRIDGE.
lb3y0v	18	28	Take a breath and calm down.
lb3y0v	19	37	There is evidence of short laddering.
lb3y0v	20	62	There is evidence that the volume here strongly favors buying.
lb3y0v	21	92	It's entirely possible that they're actually setting themselves up for a massive resurgence.
lb3y0v	22	83	On the other hand, it's also very possible that this stock is well and truly toast.
lb3y0v	23	215	As much as I've enjoyed watching the comradery around here and the exultation of the truly retarded among us, some of you need to face the reality that there are millions of subs here and only thousands of comments.
lb3y0v	24	18	There are plenty .
lb3y0v	25	8	plenty .
lb3y0v	26	54	of people who hopped in at $50 and cashed out at $500.
lb3y0v	27	149	If you think the only factor in the steady price decrease since last Thursday is Melvin, then I have bridge to sell you but please don't jump off it.
lb3y0v	28	68	come on, you can always make more money, but you only get one life .
lb3y0v	29	85	Do you know why it feels so good to be a part of this, no matter what side you're on?
lb3y0v	30	126	Two reasons one, social cohesion, which most of us have been missing for a long fucking time because of this shitass pandemic.
lb3y0v	31	135	Two, psychologists have known for decades that unexpected rewards trigger a much higher release of sweet, sweet dopamine and serotonin.
lb3y0v	32	190	When you don't know for sure a good thing is going to happen, and then it does, it literally feels better than when you are expecting a good thing to happen and then see it come to fruition.
lb3y0v	33	34	This is why gambling is addictive.
lb3y0v	34	109	And if this is your first time being introduced to the addiction centers in your brain, well, welcome aboard.
lb3y0v	35	101	hopefully it has been a lesson for you of the good and bad power of your own mind and what it can do.
lb3y0v	36	9	So again.
lb3y0v	37	21	could GME still moon?
lb3y0v	38	4	Yes.
lb3y0v	39	24	Could it crash and burn?
lb3y0v	40	4	Yes.
lb3y0v	41	79	Both of those circumstances require the right combination of factors to happen.
lb3y0v	42	79	If you're sitting here all day staring at the chart and tearing your hair out .
lb3y0v	43	5	stop.
lb3y0v	44	15	For real, stop.
lb3y0v	45	14	Close the tab.
lb3y0v	46	11	Go outside.
lb3y0v	47	62	Go hug your wife or her boyfriend and tell them you love them.
lb3y0v	48	84	You have already paid the admission price for this ride, so you may as well ride it.
lb3y0v	49	125	If you can't take the heat and want need to sell because you have a life to live, then do that if that's what you need to do.
lb3y0v	50	89	Don't hang on just because some rando on the internet posted some fucking gorilla emojis.
lb3y0v	51	157	On the other hand, if you consider your investment to be money you were truly willing to lose and want to see how this plays out, then that could be fun too.
lb3y0v	52	22	It really could rally.
lb3y0v	53	108	It's not over just yet, but you gotta fucking be honest with yourself about your limits and tolerances here.
lb3y0v	54	62	Apes together strong, but billionaire hedge funds also strong.
lb3y0v	55	152	Do your own research, come to your own conclusions, and quit sucking on the hopium dreadium teat long enough to make a decision on what to do from here.
lb3y0v	56	103	Edit forgot my positions 36 GME 99.7, not planning on selling but I can afford the price of this ride .
lb3v8m	0	40	The event that made a needed correction.
lb3v8m	1	173	For those that feel the pressure of being down 70% on whatever value you put in, you bought into a movement that is shining the largest spotlight on a long standing problem.
lb3v8m	2	163	We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process.
lb3v8m	3	50	The business of short selling is to feed on death.
lb3v8m	4	77	You make sure you're in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma.
lb3v8m	5	96	The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore.
lb3v8m	6	41	Even the night shift watch gets a payout.
lb3v8m	7	52	But they over reached this time and someone noticed.
lb3v8m	8	160	A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time.
lb3v8m	9	47	And they got asked, 'hey, what's in the needle?
lb3v8m	10	19	Are you a doctor?'.
lb3v8m	11	218	There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control.
lb3v8m	12	38	Hopefully that means something to you.
lb3v8m	13	51	I'm thankful that my money was already in position.
lb3v8m	14	272	That I could join this gathering, and that through the worry of losing it all, that it could result in some oversight on a business of promoting a good company by investing in its future, not have its head cut off by the machete wielding bully right out in broad daylight.
lb3v8m	15	11	77 GME $89.

lb255a	0	57	Aphria Tilray Merger Arbitrage Opportunity, Plus APHA vs.
lb255a	1	4	CGC.
lb255a	2	57	Well my fellow degens, I have an interesting one for you.
lb255a	3	89	Aphria $APHA and Tilray $TLRY are merging to create the world's biggest cannabis company.
lb255a	4	73	Close to 1B 874M to be exact in annualized revenues which will only grow.
lb255a	5	27	Anyways the merger states .
lb255a	6	359	"\"Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria the \"Aphria Shareholders\" will receive 0.8381 shares the \"Exchange Ratio\" of Tilray for each Aphria common share each, an \"Aphria Share\" , while holders of Tilray shares the \"Tilray Stockholders\" will continue to hold their Tilray shares the \"Tilray Shares\" with no adjustment to their holdings."
lb255a	7	127	Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.
lb255a	8	10	"\" Source ."
lb255a	9	69	This means Aphria should be trading at .8381 of Tilray's share price.
lb255a	10	36	Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 $18.86 .
lb255a	11	61	Aphria should be trading at $18.86 , yet it's only at $13.95.
lb255a	12	33	That's a whopping 34% difference.
lb255a	13	155	Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it's very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio.
lb255a	14	54	I've never seen a merger discrepancy like this before.
lb255a	15	44	If anything, Aphria should have the premium.
lb255a	16	143	Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.
lb255a	17	17	Aphria Tilray vs.
lb255a	18	5	CGC .
lb255a	19	49	Now let's compare Aphria Tilray to Canopy Growth.
lb255a	20	129	Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj.
lb255a	21	28	EBITDA loss of negative 85M.
lb255a	22	53	Furthermore, Canopy has 190M free cash flow, Source .
lb255a	23	51	Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M.
lb255a	24	86	This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them.
lb255a	25	8	Source .
lb255a	26	75	Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next.
lb255a	27	151	"\"And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID 19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. \"."
lb255a	28	31	Canopy is valued at 15.8B USD .
lb255a	29	122	Aphria Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively.
lb255a	30	141	Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.
lb255a	31	57	Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC Source .
lb255a	32	151	Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells cannabis inspired beer .
lb255a	33	73	Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon .
lb255a	34	105	TL DR Aphria should be trading 34 % higher than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.
lb255a	35	105	If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria Tilray compared to CGC.
lb255a	36	86	Disclaimer Not a financial advisor, not buy sell advice, cannabis stocks are volatile.
lb255a	37	15	Do your own DD.
lb255a	38	61	I wish everyone amazing success in their investing endeavors.

lb15mz	0	41	ICLN What's behind the $10M options play.
lb15mz	1	96	I bought to open 611 Jan 23 call options on ICLN at $45 today at $5.7 at a cost of around $350k.
lb15mz	2	95	This was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19,261 contracts bought since Friday.
lb15mz	3	127	iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds.
lb15mz	4	185	Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available $45 in recent days.
lb15mz	5	4	Why?
lb15mz	6	155	IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED from low of $8 in past year with top holding PLUG up 1800% in past year.
lb15mz	7	162	"If ICLN \"only\" doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of 80%, $5.8 options 45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry."
lb15mz	8	222	And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy the US joined this wave with Biden's plan .
lb15mz	9	118	TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks.
lb15mz	10	183	As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year.
lb15mz	11	199	So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns.

laymi9	1	180	Don't you think that banning certain stocks for buy by the major brokers is a deliberate action aimed at causing harm to their clients as they cause imbalance in the supply demand?
laymi9	2	136	If it's harder for those who want stock to buy it than to sell, this drives the price down which is definitely illegal to do in purpose.
laymi9	3	69	Shouldn't we file the lawsuits against them for causing this damage?.

lb7yrv	0	27	What is the gameplan here?.
lb7yrv	1	29	So from my understanding, if.
lb7yrv	2	79	1. Hedge funds are using short ladder attacks to drive this down to the bottom.
lb7yrv	3	59	2. Retail investors are throttled on how much they can buy.
lb7yrv	4	119	3. Hedge funds seem to be at the same time covering their short positions without bumping the price of our meme stocks.
lb7yrv	5	44	Say we keep holding and occasionally buying.
lb7yrv	6	34	at this rate, why would this work?
lb7yrv	7	199	I don't know if holding and occasionally buying from retail investors will led to any sort of rally if we're up against the systematic coordinated ladder attack by the trading algorithms hedge funds.

lb7hbj	3	106	However, if you look at the image, it says the trigger date is 2 1 and the proposed deactivation date is 2
lb7hbj	4	84	3. doesn't that mean the restriction started yesterday, and will actually end today?

lbeurn	0	58	Reasons why the Fed could not allow the squeeze to happen.
lbeurn	1	144	I'll preface with saying there will be no rocket or diamond emojis in the post so if that is what you are here for you can stop reading now lol.
lbeurn	2	215	The fed is still fixing the damage done during Feb Mar April with things like Unlimited QE, overnight swap rates at just about 0%, adding of liquidity to the markets with the buying of not only bonds but securities.
lbeurn	3	4	ect.
lbeurn	4	124	They are just barely getting it propped up again on bullshit my opinion they should have let the banks and large corps fail.
lbeurn	5	35	but that has no relevance on this .
lbeurn	6	135	The Fed absolutely could not allow these Market makers to potentially be open to legitimate infinite losses to the point of insolvency.
lbeurn	7	99	If the squeeze actually did happen and literally forced one or two MM's Clearing firms to go under.
lbeurn	8	193	This would force a huge liquidity problem in the overall markets with Market Makers having to sell off their other existing positions which pretty much keep the market propped up at the moment.
lbeurn	9	87	There are not many of these MM's so if even one failed it creates a huge systemic risk.
lbeurn	10	74	These companies are required to figure out worst cast scenarios like this.
lbeurn	11	95	So if they are required to figure out the worst case the Fed also knows what the worst case is.
lbeurn	12	81	It would be the literal un doing of everything the fed has done up to this point.
lbeurn	13	62	Do you see how many transactions companies like citadel clear?
lbeurn	14	64	Who would step in to take the place of them if they went under?.
lbeurn	15	160	Yes I'd absolutely love that to happen because we would get huge discounts on pretty much any value stock we wanted with the mass sell off like in Feb Mar Apil.
lbeurn	16	116	But do you for one second think the fed would actually let that happen again if it could be prevented ahead of time.
lbeurn	17	264	Call me a tinfoil hat if you want because maybe this is a little far fetched but I wouldn't be surprised if the fed actually played an active roll in preventing the squeeze from happening by offering suggestions and advice to the companies involved in all of this.
lbeurn	18	100	They saved the banks in 2008, they saved them again in 2020, why would they not save them this time.
lbeurn	19	153	I just don't see a way this would have ended well for the markets as a whole with everything that has been going on after the black swan that was corona.
lbeurn	20	48	So how could they possibly allow that to happen.
lberoe	0	28	Can AMC go up the other way?
lberoe	1	44	I'm fucked, but fucked with you degenerate .
lbepxi	0	10	Amarin DD.
lbepxi	1	93	The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe.
lbepxi	2	21	Both are quite right.
lbepxi	3	27	Vascepa is icosapent ethyl.
lbepxi	4	158	a purified and modified omega 3 that when taken on top of a statin think Lipitor basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%.
lbepxi	5	18	Sounds good right?
lbepxi	6	59	Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira.
lbepxi	7	60	Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa.
lbepxi	8	23	and without a pandemic.
lbepxi	9	89	Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily.
lbepxi	10	27	Lipitor had its run though.
lbepxi	11	16	Just ask Pfizer.
lbepxi	12	35	And it still sells tons of cabbage.
lbepxi	13	99	But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk.
lbepxi	14	15	Funny thing is.
lbepxi	15	61	it's not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit.
lbepxi	16	11	more later.
lbepxi	17	47	Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery.
lbepxi	18	12	and DEATH!!!
lbepxi	19	112	There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega 3's you may take.
lbepxi	20	86	But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work.
lbepxi	21	65	At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!!
lbepxi	22	24	No one really knows why.
lbepxi	23	97	We think it's it's powerful anti inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA Vascepa .
lbepxi	24	6	Think.
lbepxi	25	97	"\"it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb\"."
lbepxi	26	97	For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study.
lbepxi	27	85	Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression.
lbepxi	28	13	That's right.
lbepxi	29	55	Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!!
lbepxi	30	26	Let that sink in a minute.
lbepxi	31	105	There are two large Covid 19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE IT.
lbepxi	32	43	Prepare It will likely read out end of Feb.
lbepxi	33	28	Mitigate interim around May.
lbepxi	34	54	The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps.
lbepxi	35	116	One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir.
lbepxi	36	71	Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!!
lbepxi	37	72	It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in.
lbepxi	38	15	you guessed it.
lbepxi	39	23	fatty acids and lipids.
lbepxi	40	26	Let that sink in a minute.
lbepxi	41	58	Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019.
lbepxi	42	23	She hit $26 soon after.
lbepxi	43	286	March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN's three billion a year US market when mature.
lbepxi	44	19	we only a year in .
lbepxi	45	71	More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication.
lbepxi	46	52	not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides.
lbepxi	47	17	for pancreatitis.
lbepxi	48	39	The money is in the CVT risk reduction.
lbepxi	49	36	i.e. the statin patients world wide.
lbepxi	50	73	AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market.
lbepxi	51	46	And now generics want to try and steal it all.
lbepxi	52	48	So far so good except for the market perception.
lbepxi	53	46	AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured.
lbepxi	54	45	Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA.
lbepxi	55	36	The company that won the court case.
lbepxi	56	129	Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid.
lbepxi	57	25	Damages could be huge!!!!
lbepxi	58	112	Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April.
lbepxi	59	48	Europe's market is maybe 50% larger than the US.
lbepxi	60	92	Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market.
lbepxi	61	47	Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March.
lbepxi	62	28	Today she sits just over $8.
lbepxi	63	75	The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast.
lbepxi	64	47	Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch.
lbepxi	65	226	Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega 3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN's revenues are going to be huge.
lbepxi	66	34	Last year was unaudited $611 mill.
lbepxi	67	30	1 billion tax loss carry over.
lbepxi	68	35	550 million in cash or investments.
lbepxi	69	8	No debt.
lbepxi	70	10	Zero debt.
lbepxi	71	23	Price currently $8.25 .
lbepxi	72	113	There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle.
lbepxi	73	29	Despite that she has doubled.
lbepxi	74	177	"That the company updated its \"Change of control\" package and policy in an 8 k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent."
lbepxi	75	31	Amarin was built for a buy out.
lbepxi	76	45	She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy.
lbepxi	77	49	I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales.
lbepxi	78	21	EU $3 billion a year.
lbepxi	79	156	Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm the Chinese owned partner .
lbepxi	80	69	Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money.
lbepxi	81	46	Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short.
lbepxi	82	73	With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up.
lbepxi	83	35	The daily shenanigans need to stop.
lbepxi	84	60	The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!!
lbepxi	85	53	It's truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits.
lbepxi	86	91	I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know.
lbepxi	87	201	Let's see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery.
lbepxi	88	60	I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY .
lbepxi	89	21	then HOLDS her gains.
lbepxi	90	56	There won't be a find a chair when the music stops here.
lbepxi	91	34	Your consideration is appreciated.
lbechw	0	139	Down 55%, and keep getting orders rejected by E Trade NASDAQ as the market gets halted, Fuck em, I'll hold until it hits proxima centauri .
lbe80d	0	19	GME and $80 Stocks.
lbe80d	1	17	Why to not worry.
lbe80d	2	10	Oh my god!
lbe80d	3	20	GME is down to $150!
lbe80d	4	18	It's down to $100!
lbe80d	5	22	It's down to 30 cents!
lbe80d	6	75	The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point!
lbe80d	7	11	It's over!.
lbe80d	8	6	Wrong.
lbe80d	9	34	No one is selling at these prices.
lbe80d	10	56	Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better.
lbe80d	11	37	Maybe they trigger a few stop losses.
lbe80d	12	30	Maybe some margins get called.
lbe80d	13	20	But it's not enough.
lbe80d	14	16	Say it with me .
lbe80d	15	22	PRICE DOESN'T MATTER .
lbe80d	16	7	WHAT?!.
lbe80d	17	13	You heard me.
lbe80d	18	11	30cent GME?
lbe80d	19	11	No problem.
lbe80d	20	51	They don't need a low price, they need your shares.
lbe80d	21	126	"If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a \"30 cent stock\" but Melvin only netted ten shares."
lbe80d	22	22	They are still fucked.
lbe80d	23	90	They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.
lbe80d	24	27	It's an availability issue.
lbe80d	25	88	Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue too high for them but primarily it's the availability.
lbe80d	26	155	All the activity driving down the listed share price are illegal ladder attacks not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks .
lbe80d	27	87	Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie.
lbe80d	28	30	They aren't gobbling up value.
lbe80d	29	84	These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks.
lbe80d	30	28	They need 50 million shares.
lbe80d	31	141	They need over 100% of the float to sell to them that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed .
lbe80d	32	71	You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.
lbe80d	33	95	We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.
lbe80d	34	56	I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat .
lbe80d	35	22	PRICE DOESN'T MATTER .
lbe80d	36	129	So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market .
lbe80d	37	11	of Shares .
lbe80d	38	7	Price .
lbe80d	39	6	x 20 .
lbe80d	40	7	$0.30c.
lbe80d	41	6	x 80 .
lbe80d	42	3	$5.
lbe80d	43	7	x 400 .
lbe80d	44	4	$20.
lbe80d	45	7	x 600 .
lbe80d	46	4	$40.
lbe80d	47	7	x 900 .
lbe80d	48	4	$60.
lbe80d	49	9	x 2,000 .
lbe80d	50	5	$100.
lbe80d	51	9	x 5,000 .
lbe80d	52	5	$150.
lbe80d	53	10	x 10,000 .
lbe80d	54	5	$200.
lbe80d	55	10	x 30,000 .
lbe80d	56	5	$300.
lbe80d	57	10	x 50,000 .
lbe80d	58	5	$400.
lbe80d	59	11	x 150,000 .
lbe80d	60	5	$500.
lbe80d	61	9	x 1 mil .
lbe80d	62	7	$1,000.
lbe80d	63	10	x 15 mil .
lbe80d	64	7	$5,000.
lbe80d	65	10	x 30 mil .
lbe80d	66	8	$69,420.
lbe80d	67	7	Get it?
lbe80d	68	64	There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices.
lbe80d	69	118	By the time you've bought a quarter million shares 0.5% of what you need to buy you're back up to the sustained highs.
lbe80d	70	49	And these are just exaggerations to make a point.
lbe80d	71	84	A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices .
lbe80d	72	275	If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment.
lbe80d	73	43	There's no volume to buy up at those costs.
lbe80d	74	41	No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.
lbe80d	75	8	Get it?.
lbe80d	76	22	PRICE DOESN'T MATTER .
lbe80d	77	38	They need our shares, not a low price.
lbe80d	78	59	The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not.
lbe80d	79	74	Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that.
lbe80d	80	48	But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in.
lbe80d	81	66	Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end.
lbe80d	82	188	People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.
lbe80d	83	147	This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.
lbe7t2	0	22	From 3.2 mill to 578k.
lbe7t2	1	14	Still Holding!
lbdwai	0	48	Here's some loss porn for tonight's tug session.
lbdwai	1	13	10k or bust .
lbdosp	0	50	Federal law requires reporting of short positions.
lbdosp	1	101	So this is something I just found out about, and I thought everyone else might be interested as well.
lbdosp	2	213	Remember how it's a giant mystery as to who has had a short position on gme and we were just going off a rumor mill for months that it was Melivin well until Melvin publicly reported almost going out of business .
lbdosp	3	171	So it turns out since 2010 when the Dodd Frank act was signed into law investing managers have been required to to disclose short positions, just like they do their longs.
lbdosp	4	43	The SEC just chooses not to implement this.
lbdosp	5	156	Considering naked short attacks are what took down the banks in '08 turning that mess into a crisis, it's crazy the SEC doesn't have to respect federal law.
lbdosp	6	128	The law itself is giant, but there's also a bunch of public comments on the SEC site encouraging them to actually do their job .
lbdosp	7	137	If anyone is interested in suggesting they actually implement 929x from the Dodd Frank Act there's a page on sending in public comments .
lbdgym	0	51	Andy Jassy as the next Ceo of Amazon is big for BB.
lbdgym	1	85	Today we saw the lord Bezos step down but why is this big for blackberry you may ask?
lbdgym	2	150	Well because Andy Jassy, the next CEO of Amazon and also the current CEO of Amazon Web Services is a huge blackberry IVY shill and why wouldn't he be?
lbdgym	3	121	This guy is going to be seeing a lot more media attention the next few months and guess what he's gonna be talking about.
lbdgym	4	65	Blackberry fucking IVY and all the partnerships AWS has lined up.

lbdaf6	0	49	I spent some time looking into Failed to Deliver.
lbdaf6	1	59	Hopefully, this is some useful information for all of you!.
lbdaf6	2	57	So the SEC has a failed to deliver report under the FIOA.
lbdaf6	3	125	It looks like it only updates this data bi monthly for the 1 15 16 30th and the next report is due out at or around the 15th.
lbdaf6	4	66	I am going to call the SEC tomorrow and ask for intermediate data.
lbdaf6	5	22	We need this data NOW.
lbdaf6	6	20	If you look at this.
lbdaf6	7	55	GME has failed to deliver a LOT of shares all the time.
lbdaf6	8	54	When I did some highschool excel Data Analytics on it.
lbdaf6	9	58	It is the 60th stock on the list when sorted by of shares.
lbdaf6	10	33	From the SEC regarding this data.
lbdaf6	11	142	"\"The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails."
lbdaf6	12	156	In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails.
lbdaf6	13	26	Looking at the above site.
lbdaf6	14	55	There are links to information about Failed to deliver.
lbdaf6	15	40	Is GME considered a Threshold Security .
lbdaf6	16	196	In order to be deemed a threshold security, and thus subject to the restrictions of Rule 203 b 3 , a security must exceed the specified fail level for a period of five consecutive settlement days.
lbdaf6	17	178	Similarly, in order to be removed from the list of threshold securities, a security must not exceed the specified level of fails for a period of five consecutive settlement days.
lbdaf6	18	46	Does the Firm have to close out the positions?
lbdaf6	19	252	"As adopted, Rule 203 b 3 requires any participant of a registered clearing agency \"participant\" 80 to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, i.e. , 13 consecutive settlement days."
lbdaf6	20	124	81 the participant is required to close out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.
lbdaf6	21	106	Rule 203 b 3 is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.
lbdaf6	22	113	89 We believe that the five day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.
lbdaf6	23	74	So Dumb ass me looked further back in time to the second half of December.
lbdaf6	24	57	It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.
lbdaf6	25	58	This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.
lbdaf6	26	32	We are over the 10 13 Day limit.
lbdaf6	27	21	What's going on here.
lbdaf6	28	73	How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day.
lbdaf6	29	35	clearly something is going on here.
lbdaf6	30	32	How are they CONSTANTLY failing?
lbdaf6	31	69	Well, that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.
lbdaf6	32	51	This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.
lbdaf6	33	15	For comparison.
lbdaf6	34	11	Here is AA.
lbdaf6	35	53	Notice almost none, clearly not manipulated an issue.
lbdaf6	36	40	Here is a dumb sorted list by of shares.
lbdaf6	37	15	Edit Positions.
lbdaf6	38	30	AMC and like 5 shares of GME .
lbdaf6	39	21	Edit2 Removing totals
lbd9pt	0	29	GME Devil's Advocate Part 3 .
lbd9pt	1	33	A solid example of managing risk.
lbd9pt	2	29	Part 1 GME, an unseen enemy .
lbd9pt	3	54	Part 2 GME, risk, what is worthwhile and what is not .
lbd9pt	4	19	And now we're here.
lbd9pt	5	84	It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.
lbd9pt	6	39	Do you bother fucking reading anything?
lbd9pt	7	5	Ever?
lbd9pt	8	40	I mean, I get it, I write walls of text.
lbd9pt	9	80	but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture.
lbd9pt	10	29	Come on, that's prime savant!
lbd9pt	11	61	You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.
lbd9pt	12	20	Here's what I mean,.
lbd9pt	13	68	This is one of the first few posts by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019..
lbd9pt	14	50	All other things ignored, do you notice something?
lbd9pt	15	24	"Look at the \"CASH\" pile."
lbd9pt	16	21	It reads $13,962.21 .
lbd9pt	17	108	"Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of \"he hasn't sold\"."
lbd9pt	18	94	I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management.
lbd9pt	19	72	So let's skip a few months and head straight to December 17 2020, here .
lbd9pt	20	21	Notice something odd?
lbd9pt	21	21	Something remarkable?
lbd9pt	22	34	The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.
lbd9pt	23	173	Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb .
lbd9pt	24	95	But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do.
lbd9pt	25	121	We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.
lbd9pt	26	20	Cool, let's move on.
lbd9pt	27	13	Total $3.6m .
lbd9pt	28	40	Cash pile on Dec 25, 2020 $1,116,831.85.
lbd9pt	29	14	Total $5.78m .
lbd9pt	30	40	Cash pile on Jan 13, 2021 $1,128,842.20.
lbd9pt	31	16	Total $22.845m .
lbd9pt	32	40	Cash pile on Jan 26, 2021 $4,840,638.95.
lbd9pt	33	16	Total $22.171m .
lbd9pt	34	41	Cash pile on Feb 02, 2021 $13,817,567.62.
lbd9pt	35	54	Do you notice a trend, you smooth brained jizz rocket?
lbd9pt	36	21	I really hope you do.
lbd9pt	37	59	DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor.
lbd9pt	38	54	How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs.
lbd9pt	39	131	His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth.
lbd9pt	40	39	Watch his videos, and you'll find that.
lbd9pt	41	84	He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake.
lbd9pt	42	206	"and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the \"Total pile\", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already."
lbd9pt	43	42	And as always, he's letting the rest ride.
lbd9pt	44	15	This is called.
lbd9pt	45	25	letting the winners ride.
lbd9pt	46	110	You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant.
lbd9pt	47	50	Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.
lbd9pt	48	45	Now, read his future daily updates carefully.
lbd9pt	49	8	I'm out.
lbd9pt	50	44	TLDR You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR.
lbd9pt	51	13	but I'll try.
lbd9pt	52	103	"DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always \"If he's still in, I'm still in\"."
lbd9pt	53	84	In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy.
lbd9pt	54	14	Rightfully so.

lbcwf4	0	78	LETS PROVE EVERYONE WRONG AND OVERCOME EVERYTHING APES ARE INVINCIBLE TOGETHER
lbcuey	0	33	Back to the mars rocket I guess .
lbcmu5	0	41	Plans from here on, we have many options.
lbcmu5	1	96	Fellow Degenerates, happy day to you all, or not considering we got ripped 2 new assholes today.
lbcmu5	2	98	Anyway, besides that fact I want to get some insight on what your plans for the next few days are?
lbcmu5	3	83	First let me start off by saying that I have not sold a single share of GME OR AMC.
lbcmu5	4	18	I am holding both.
lbcmu5	5	113	But I did have 55x $5 calls for AMC that I sold on expiration day Jan 29th which netted me a very healthy profit.
lbcmu5	6	53	I feel as if the true squeeze has not yet even begun.
lbcmu5	7	155	In the back of my mind I have this crazy theory that the market makers and hedge funds deliberately and illegally drove the price down for one main reason.
lbcmu5	8	49	They now want to be apart of the squeeze as well.
lbcmu5	9	91	I mean from a financial standpoint why would they not want to make thousands of % of gains?
lbcmu5	10	53	When instead they can only make 100% when they short.
lbcmu5	11	153	They are starting to realize the true power behind this movement, they know that it is not going to be easily stopped and the main squeeze is inevitable.
lbcmu5	12	26	Now what do bagholders do?
lbcmu5	13	37	Well frankly you have 2 options here.
lbcmu5	14	74	Option 1 is, continue to hold your bags patiently and wait until the moon.
lbcmu5	15	77	Option 2 continue to hold your bags and wait until we land on fucking Pluto .
lbcmu5	16	117	Now there is also a option 3 and that option is to close your position and take whatever money you have left and run.
lbcmu5	17	31	This option sucks donkey ducks.
lbcmu5	18	104	And in turn will probably cause you life long depression when and if we squeeze to astronomical heights.
lbcmu5	19	52	Now, I say this with a heavy heart, but if you sold.
lbcmu5	20	13	Your a bitch.
lbcmu5	21	56	If you feel stupid for buying in, then you probably are.
lbcmu5	22	31	We all know what the risks are.
lbcmu5	23	95	Who buys a stock that goes from $2 to $500 in a matter of days and then wonders why it dropped?
lbcmu5	24	15	You, you bitch.
lbcmu5	25	51	Do not be clueless, do not let this demotivate you.
lbcmu5	26	30	You don't lose until you sell.
lbcmu5	27	27	You still have your shares.
lbcmu5	28	143	Doesn't matter what you paid for them at this point because if you bought at $500 you 10000% were not planning on selling at $525 or even $575.
lbcmu5	29	28	So nothing here has changed.
lbcmu5	30	28	Wait until the real squeeze.
lbcmu5	31	80	And if all else fails, well you can look back and say you were apart of history.
lbcmu5	32	37	Not that anyone is gonna give a fuck.
lbcmu5	33	21	Anyways fuck you all.
lbcmu5	34	10	Thank you.
lbcmu5	35	12	And so long!
lbcmu5	36	11	Much love!!
lbcin7	0	23	$GME, what comes next?.
lbcin7	1	65	Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type .
lbcin7	2	47	GME will not become bankrupt in the short term.
lbcin7	3	100	If you believe GME will go bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely broken.
lbcin7	4	44	The shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy.
lbcin7	5	40	That's why they dared to short GME 100%.
lbcin7	6	82	If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than what GME was initially worth.
lbcin7	7	48	That's literally printing money out of thin air.
lbcin7	8	123	But it absolutely requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will never ever have to be bought back.
lbcin7	9	57	Now, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point.
lbcin7	10	22	So what happens next?.
lbcin7	11	45	When the share price drops, 3 things happen .
lbcin7	12	22	1. paper handers sell.
lbcin7	13	23	2. diamond handers buy.
lbcin7	14	28	3. short sellers must cover.
lbcin7	15	46	As prices drop, 1 will get fewer as they sell.
lbcin7	16	85	Since share price won't go to 0, 3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible.
lbcin7	17	24	2 will buy in massively.
lbcin7	18	36	At this stage, liquidity evaporates.
lbcin7	19	18	What happens then?
lbcin7	20	6	MOASS.
lbcin7	21	84	This is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze.
lbcin7	22	144	The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.
lbcin7	23	135	Alternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up.
lbcin7	24	43	For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen.

lbbykw	11	45	The financial media are owned by Wall Street.

lb9rmm	17	107	AMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.

lbtvg5	3	114	I ended up more than doubling my account, took the gains and parked them between ARKF, ARKG, ARKK, ARKQ, and CSXE.
lbtvg5	4	39	Been going nice these past couple days.
lbtvg5	5	49	Though, I'll definitely miss those 100% days lol.

lbttxt	0	61	New stimulus checks may be the fuel to send GME higher again.
lbttxt	1	308	Unlike prior rounds where stimulus checks were spread around amongst many big tech stocks, this go around stimulus checks may go straight into GME and that concerted buying effort may be the catalyst that sends GME much higher now that new short positions may have been re established in the $200 $400 range.
lbttxt	2	289	For the record, I do not have a position yet and would never entertain buying GME under normal conditions because the fundamentals are not there, but I will be watching closely what the stimulus package will look like and how big if they tighten the brackets of who receives checks or not.

lbtc9x	0	21	Why I am not selling.
lbtc9x	1	115	First off this is probably going to be kinda long as I'm stuck at home while my girlfriend is out with her husband.
lbtc9x	2	54	And I've got nothing to do while my game is updating .
lbtc9x	3	75	"I saw alot of people posting why they were behind the \"movement\" last week."
lbtc9x	4	114	"Saying \"Wall Street took everything from us\" ect ect yada yada so I wanted to give my two pence at this low point."
lbtc9x	5	96	I was ten when the 2008 wall street crash happened I remember watching it on the TV with my dad.
lbtc9x	6	191	And he was stressing out about a overdue bill letter stack about the size of my prepubescent head, all I remember thinks is how can this effect us in a little village in the North of England.
lbtc9x	7	73	And those people all looked so happy on the balcony what's the big deal?.
lbtc9x	8	140	Well skip forward a year and my dad took off and left the house a tip smashed windows, TV everything and left my mum with a big pile of det.
lbtc9x	9	24	She struggled to pay of.
lbtc9x	10	39	While raising three kids but we got by.
lbtc9x	11	196	When I was fourteen I got a job and I've been working ever since I passed up on collage and university for work and I'm only just starting to realise what a big mistake that was and get my degree.
lbtc9x	12	175	A few years ago when I was nineteen I walked happily in to the arms of a forex guru that promised me I would get rich quick and be able to quit my job and make loads of money.
lbtc9x	13	142	That ended up as I'm sure I have no need to tell this sub with me back on my mums sofa not a pence to my name actually about three grand down.
lbtc9x	14	52	Crying in to my hands and thinking my life was over.
lbtc9x	15	207	I went on a dmp det management plan for all you newbie degens out there the woman on the phone asked all my income my out goings ect ect, then told me calmly that it would take me 3 years to pay off 3 grand!
lbtc9x	16	73	I hung up the phone changed my job became a utter wage slave working 60 .
lbtc9x	17	39	70 hours a week to get back on my feet.
lbtc9x	18	38	Nine months later I was and then sum .
lbtc9x	19	36	It wasn't easy but I got through it.
lbtc9x	20	81	This time when I heard about gme two weeks ago on reddit at 2 in the the morning.
lbtc9x	21	71	I understood it wasn't a get rich scheme it was just a good stock pick.
lbtc9x	22	101	I did my own dd as I advise you retards do and decided to put a small portion of my savings in to it.
lbtc9x	23	135	I was lucky I've been in since 38 I've seen more money then I've ever had in my life on my screen in the past week and I've seen it go.
lbtc9x	24	52	But I don't believe this is over not by a long shot.
lbtc9x	25	65	Because you can't get rich quick that's not how this thing works.
lbtc9x	26	41	Now please look after your mental health.
lbtc9x	27	46	Don't invest more then you can afford to lose.

lbsufh	0	37	VIAC investor day and the super bowl.
lbsufh	1	46	A new idea I've seen and god knows we need it.
lbsufh	2	259	I posted others posted, bunch of people are actually following the trade, let's talk about how this firm is launching a major new product on the super bowl and then the investor day right after on 2 24 we need to look at this as a new opportunity for profits.
lbsufh	3	296	I respect all on this forum, the suits are fucking you and while I fear for those jumping in at the top I will love to see the blood on wall st when GME is at 1000 and all the other wins but this one is a different trade for those that made some wins and need to diversify into new opportunities.
lbsufh	4	81	Ok so we have already been winning on VIAC I've been on the long side for over a.
lbsufh	5	45	Year and buying calls over the past 4 months.
lbsufh	6	73	In currently long VIAC calls for 2 26 3 19 and long dated calls for 2022.
lbsufh	7	59	Strike prices between 50 55 and 60 on the long dated calls.
lbsufh	8	128	Overall my positions are over 15k in calls but I am actively trading and plan to size up even more before the 2 24 investor day.
lbsufh	9	38	One of my biggest trades ever frankly.
lbsufh	10	71	The Reason I like this so much is the Unknown possibilities on content.
lbsufh	11	129	I'm talking all the possible good ideas, miramax deal, avatar last air bender series, all kinds of possible shows from paramount.
lbsufh	12	81	I'm not doing this justice because there is so much to discuss it's overwhelming.
lbsufh	13	201	My theory is we could see real advances in content from the firm for all parties including NFLX, AMNZ, DIS, and the other customers that need additional content on top of their existing creation slate.
lbsufh	14	41	Up coming investor day will be just like.
lbsufh	15	80	The Disney investor day in that we will be blown away with surprise of ambition.
lbsufh	16	98	I expect the redstones have been waiting 5 years for this event and they will make the most of it.
lbsufh	17	181	We can expect so much possibilities from this 2 months ahead for VIAC if your not interested in the trade then do your own thing but if you want to make money climb the fuck aboard.
lbsufh	18	69	Do your own research but if you do I think you will get very excited.

lbs97i	0	18	$CRSR Corsair DD .
lbs97i	1	73	The Q4 results are basically already out and nobody is talking about it!.
lbs97i	2	262	"\"While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do They looked\"."
lbs97i	3	11	Big Short .
lbs97i	4	47	I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair.
lbs97i	5	34	We all know it's a great business.
lbs97i	6	42	What I want to focus on is the financials.
lbs97i	7	76	More specifically We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it!
lbs97i	8	4	Why?
lbs97i	9	25	Because nobody looked!!!.
lbs97i	10	155	Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders totally normal as it's mostly the private equity owner EagleTree .
lbs97i	11	65	selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership .
lbs97i	12	100	they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold It's totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit .
lbs97i	13	50	Here's the prospectus dated 21st of January 2021 .
lbs97i	14	40	1 Now, check out page 9 of the document.
lbs97i	15	49	For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect .
lbs97i	16	74	Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million.
lbs97i	17	69	Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million.
lbs97i	18	66	Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million.
lbs97i	19	67	Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates .
lbs97i	20	72	In fact, the company initially estimated the following from Q3 release .
lbs97i	21	45	For the full year 2020, we currently expect .
lbs97i	22	67	Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.
lbs97i	23	77	Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.
lbs97i	24	122	Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.Then, they updated the guidance on November 30th 2020 .
lbs97i	25	45	For the full year 2020, we currently expect .
lbs97i	26	67	Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
lbs97i	27	77	Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
lbs97i	28	67	Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.
lbs97i	29	62	So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates.
lbs97i	30	7	Great!!
lbs97i	31	15	Really great!!.
lbs97i	32	112	2 But that's not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 Again we just need to look .
lbs97i	33	215	"As they mention on the Q3 report, \"as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long term debt of $370.1 million\"."
lbs97i	34	39	In the more recent prospectus page 10 .
lbs97i	35	309	In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020..
lbs97i	36	60	This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M $370 .
lbs97i	37	89	$120 of cash to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.
lbs97i	38	94	As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020.
lbs97i	39	121	So this implies around 150M FCF in 2020 as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M .
lbs97i	40	60	check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here .
lbs97i	41	69	At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap 91.92M of shares outstanding .
lbs97i	42	51	This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%.
lbs97i	43	196	I'd be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is 60.7% growth year over year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4 .
lbs97i	44	65	Now, you must be thinking but the smart money already knows this!
lbs97i	45	28	They have accounted for it!.
lbs97i	46	133	I used to be like you I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!.
lbs97i	47	12	No f way!!!.
lbs97i	48	103	Take a look at Goldman Sachs' research from February 1st 2021 yes, after the prospectus was published .
lbs97i	49	28	Someone shared it on reddit.
lbs97i	50	73	They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020.
lbs97i	51	147	"No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated \"guidance\" more than a guidance, it's actually the results given how close the ranges are ."
lbs97i	52	14	TLDR Corsair .
lbs97i	53	23	Positions 40k in shares

lbrjif	3	44	This is what got us here in the first place.
lbrjif	4	41	Why we are even having this conversation.
lbrjif	5	131	In the mainstream media, in the twitter feeds of billionaires, of Mark fucking Cuban doing an AMA on here, and telling us to HOLD .
lbrjif	6	127	If you bought into GME for a quick flip to double your portfolio and make tendies like I did, than you may have made a mistake.
lbrjif	7	79	But here's the thing, I will repeat it again for all you retards to understand.
lbrjif	8	26	YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL.
lbrjif	9	57	Mark had some incredibly solid words of wisdom yesterday.
lbrjif	10	29	Why should you listen to him?
lbrjif	11	63	Because he is a billionaire entrepreneur and a no bullshit guy.
lbrjif	12	36	He didn't come on here to lie to us.
lbrjif	13	37	He came on here to genuinely help us.
lbrjif	14	29	SO, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?
lbrjif	15	17	We need to HOLD .
lbrjif	16	77	We need to hold because the lower this stock goes, the more leverage we have.
lbrjif	17	82	We need to hold because we are not pussy fucking paper hands, and this is the way.
lbrjif	18	98	GameStop, with the leadership of Ryan Cohen, is going to capitalize on this primetime opportunity.
lbrjif	19	63	We are already seeing this today with the hire of Matt Francis.
lbrjif	20	32	The shift to e commerce is real.

lbqkp5	4	83	Their gen1 vaccine provoked good T cell and B cell responses in non human primates.
lbqkp5	5	135	CVAC just signed a production deal with Bayer and a partnership with GSK to test a multivalent vaccine against emerging spike variants.

lbqdul	0	38	Not just a holder, but a shareHODLER!.
lbqdul	1	59	I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.
lbqdul	2	26	My brain is glassy smooth.
lbqdul	3	267	TLDR Do what you can to increase the value of GME You can do this by holding with conviction, buying more shares, understanding the value of GME and GameStop, increase Goodwill, spending, and publicity of GameStop, and participate in once a year shareholder meetings.
lbqdul	4	127	Many of us bought GME for the quick buck and had the hedge funds not pulled their bullshit last week, it would have popped off.
lbqdul	5	147	Instead, they have mitigated some risk and pushed back the deadline, trying to buy themselves more time in the hopes that we will give up and sell.
lbqdul	6	172	In turn, many of us are tapped out or overleveraged seriously, don't bet more than you can afford to lose, if you are over that amount already, do what you can to mitigate.
lbqdul	7	36	Also, determine your risk tolerance!
lbqdul	8	67	The hedge funds looked at the events last week and changed tactics.
lbqdul	9	25	ShareHODLERS can as well.
lbqdul	10	158	Understand that this is a long term strategy, but whether you plan to hold the stock for a short term or a long term, this is beneficial to all of us and GME.
lbqdul	11	120	We don't know when the full squeeze will happen, thus a longer term strategy on top of your current will benefit us all.
lbqdul	12	35	What does being a shareHODLER mean?
lbqdul	13	113	Now that you own a share or more of GME, Gamestop has a fiduciary requirement to maximize the VALUE of the stock.
lbqdul	14	112	As a ShareHODLER, you can help them, and in turn, increase demand for your shares by doing any of the following.
lbqdul	15	48	Things you can do to be a good GME shareHODLER .
lbqdul	16	35	A Hold your shares with conviction.
lbqdul	17	110	B Increase your voting power BUY more shares if it's within your risk tolerance and you are not overleveraged.
lbqdul	18	53	C Understand the future VALUE of the shares you hold.
lbqdul	19	80	I highly recommend checking out www.gmedd.com which was created by WSB members .
lbqdul	20	62	question this, challenge it, and come to your own conclusions.
lbqdul	21	310	They make a fair argument that GME is legitimately worth $32 and $169, but that does not consider the positive impact that this all squeeze will have on the company more customers will hear about the Executive's efforts to rebuild the brand, more people will choose to buy from GameStop instead of Amazon, etc.
lbqdul	22	89	To consider the impact of this, I propose a multiplier of between 1.1 and 1.3 bear case .
lbqdul	23	113	$35.2 to $41.6 bull case $185.9 to $219.7 Remember The stock market deals in future value, not present day value.
lbqdul	24	131	Additionally, understand what GameStop has to offer www.gamestop.com and en.wikipedia.org wiki GameStop Owned brands and concepts .
lbqdul	25	75	E Increase GME's goodwill, your spending at GameStop, and promote Gamestop.
lbqdul	26	55	Goodwill is an asset line item on the fiscal quarterly.
lbqdul	27	158	"\"Goodwill and asset impairments\" here Anything we can do to increase the fair market value or future value of GME will increase the pressure on short sellers."
lbqdul	28	121	Yes, this means people spending GME earnings on donations is extremely beneficial as that adds to the Goodwill line item.
lbqdul	29	42	F Participate in GME shareholder meetings.
lbqdul	30	59	Maybe the squeeze gets drawn out or maybe you are long GME.
lbqdul	31	73	Either way, the shareholder meeting is likely to be around mid June 2021.
lbqdul	32	243	If retail investors own over 50% of the voting shares, we can force institutions who have been lending out their shares to recall them temporarily stop lending their shares to short sellers so that they can vote to counter retail voting power.
lbqdul	33	44	Shareholder meetings only occur once a year.
lbqdir	0	18	Still not selling!
lbqdir	1	86	I had friends who bought more at the dip yesterday and I will continue to add as well!
lbqdgo	0	16	GME TO MARSS!!!.
lbqdgo	1	61	MORE GREENS NEEDED Please dont let my money go to waste lool.
lbqa3q	0	86	GME Victory Conditions for Hedge Funds vs. the Unwashed Masses Actual DD double down .
lbqa3q	1	60	I think we should discuss how either side of the trade wins.
lbqa3q	2	90	We all know about short interest, possible short ladder attacks, low volume, and all that.
lbqa3q	3	120	But there is an argument I read yet the further the price goes down, the more difficult it is to actually push it lower.
lbqa3q	4	146	If these funds swapping around shares is the primary driver of the collapse in price, then they will confront a prisoner's dilemma type situation.
lbqa3q	5	211	Seeing the possibility of the largest bomb in financial history detonating, each financial firm that has gone short knows full well that others want to cut their losses, lick their wounds, and fight another day.
lbqa3q	6	87	As we know if one firm closes some of their shorts, the demand, and the price increase.
lbqa3q	7	54	But the bomb is still there looming in the background.
lbqa3q	8	227	The worst case scenario for holders of GME is the steady unloading of shorts over a long period of time, where the de loading process is less expensive than the margin interest that these firms have to pay to keep their shares.
lbqa3q	9	75	So, think the price of GME remaining steady at like $20 or $30 for months .
lbqa3q	10	35	an acceptable loss for hedge funds.
lbqa3q	11	95	To do this, almost every short fund would have to agree to collaborate in near perfect harmony.
lbqa3q	12	43	And, as we know, that is nearly impossible.
lbqa3q	13	64	It's going to take a really long time for us to go back to $17 .
lbqa3q	14	43	this is just not possible in the short run.
lbqa3q	15	81	To make matters worse for the firms, the short interest increased to around 212%.
lbqa3q	16	39	The bomb has only grown more dangerous.
lbqa3q	17	45	As long as this is the case, you should hold.
lbqa3q	18	142	Months can feel like years, but if we are resilient and GME actually does decently as a company, these short positions are going to bleed out.
lbqa3q	19	112	I just don't see how unwinding these positions is probable when a single closed position could set off the bomb.
lbqa3q	20	41	But then again, I don't know how to read.

lbn7ge	3	242	A quick note I am autistic, and proper references to census data are too fucking hard when most of this shit is really obvious and logical to me, so go buy some chicken nuggets to make yourself feel better about being overweight because i do.
lbn7ge	4	72	I will, however, endeavour to find sources on equitable internet access.
lbn7ge	5	148	I cannot provide screenshots of facebook groups due to privacy, but there are various groups easy to access such as global educator collective etc..
lbn7ge	6	50	or use your tendies to buy switches for hospitals.
lbn7ge	7	9	Relevant.
lbn7ge	8	70	There's 330 million people in the us, maybe less now because of Covid.
lbn7ge	9	107	I'm a member of multiple teacher groups, as I was interested in how people are adapting to online learning.
lbn7ge	10	17	Here's the thing.
lbn7ge	11	36	THEY HAVE TRIED AND ITS REALLY HARD.
lbn7ge	12	193	And the reason is simple a huge buttfuckton of the students, the people, have shitty internet access, no internet access, or live in some feudal comcast net neutrality repealed fucknut kingdom.
lbn7ge	13	143	A real quick search of one group I'm in shows that for one district in michigan, they have 50% of the student body without ANY internet access.
lbn7ge	14	48	Yeah, digital age coming along for those people.
lbn7ge	15	191	Why do you people keep raving about the digital age when so many people don't have an internet connection strong enough to download an IOS update in less than 5 hours, let alone a COD update.
lbn7ge	16	60	Those people aren't living in big cities, but rural centres.
lbn7ge	17	62	Still, their internet is almost as good as mine, in Australia.
lbn7ge	18	29	Most of the people here have.
lbn7ge	19	27	privileged internet access.
lbn7ge	20	98	But I bet my fucking balls there's more than a few people here who have average, or poor internet.
lbn7ge	21	29	Some issue with their biller.
lbn7ge	22	26	What does't cost internet?
lbn7ge	23	14	Physical shit.
lbn7ge	24	319	And in a place like the US where I'm sure there are people in lower SES communities afraid of doing a craigslist buy for a secondhand disk because they might get robbed, fleeced or shot, there's a huge market for a middleman who at least won't disappear of craigslist after you find out the game is scratched or broken.
lbn7ge	25	220	That also doesn't include how a huge proportion of gamers are now women, and who don't have the male privilege of not viewing everything as a potential attack, especially given the virality of metoo in the last 10 years.
lbn7ge	26	183	So, just how many potential customers, or rather, nearly guaranteed customers because poor people buy shit to make them happy to distract them from being poor, or for social capital .
lbn7ge	27	141	More than a few people have boasted about using funds gained to buy things they need, or to donate things like a switch or ten to a hospital.
lbn7ge	28	149	Because we all know that when life really fucking sucks if you've got a video game you can play then you are able to at least escape, just for a bit.
lbn7ge	29	40	I'm gonna play super metroid after this.
lbn7ge	30	28	What does all of this spell?
lbn7ge	31	491	It spells that half the reason that people are betting against gamestop is because a bunch of old people, due to their own privilege and inability to understand the social economics of why and how people play video games, have failed to understand that regardless of gamestop's need to pivot to the lucrative metropolitan market, that until there is ubiquitous internet access for ALL americans, Gamestop has a VALUABLE place in the market as a safe place for pixel purveyors to do business.
lbn7ge	32	135	As the reply to the reply, yes amazon is a big online retailer and makes big money because people who like convenience also shop there.
lbn7ge	33	5	True.
lbn7ge	34	150	But also good luck returning what you bought from amazon, and good luck selling shit on there, it's not ebay, and inaccessible for the average punter.
lbn7ge	35	54	In sum of my short, poorly referenced sociology post,.
lbn7ge	36	75	FUCKING BUY GME and HOLD IT LIKE ITS YOUR LAST WANK BEFORE NO NUT NOVEMBER.
lbn7ge	37	43	This is also not financial or legal advice.
lbn7ge	38	19	This is just logic.
lbn7ge	39	144	Sources on internet access remember, your US averages are heavily skewed by population centres like san francisco, silicon valley, new york etc.

lbkyne	0	40	DD Why GME Valuation is valid at $300 ?.
lbkyne	1	73	The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations.
lbkyne	2	260	Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.
lbkyne	3	83	For the apes autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap.
lbkyne	4	63	It's the share price outstanding shares not just float shares .
lbkyne	5	136	GME Market Cap Valuation at $300 share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b $300 69.75M shares .
lbkyne	6	94	The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share.
lbkyne	7	37	This is often just called a multiple.
lbkyne	8	76	That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300 share price.
lbkyne	9	143	Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.
lbkyne	10	138	According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36.
lbkyne	11	124	Ulta Beauty Inc ULTA which is an in person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS.
lbkyne	12	8	Source .
lbkyne	13	118	Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it.
lbkyne	14	106	In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020.
lbkyne	15	161	But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of $0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of $0.85.
lbkyne	16	36	The consensus for the year is $2.07.
lbkyne	17	117	But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.
lbkyne	18	125	Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital.
lbkyne	19	28	Innovation and growth costs.
lbkyne	20	63	GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate.
lbkyne	21	273	If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3 $5 EPS within a couple of years that is roughly $0.75 .
lbkyne	22	19	$1.25 per quarter .
lbkyne	23	181	At a $4 EPS in between the two , this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself.
lbkyne	24	136	While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here.
lbkyne	25	128	What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations.
lbkyne	26	72	TSLA P E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4.
lbkyne	27	16	Toyota is 14.86.
lbkyne	28	66	Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4 WTF Chart of the year .
lbkyne	29	99	but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low.
lbkyne	30	62	The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k.
lbkyne	31	15	The difference?
lbkyne	32	143	Enough people said f u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.
lbkyne	33	23	Note I'm long GME $325.

lbjv0f	0	103	Motivation Wednesday $GME My diary notes Remember the loyal soldiers who standed besides King Leonides.
lbjv0f	1	73	This is us, the diamond hands, standing our ground next to the King DFV .
lbjv0f	2	42	Day three of the second week of the fight.
lbjv0f	3	12	Dear diary,.
lbjv0f	4	46	Last week we had seen some shit in the market.
lbjv0f	5	57	Brokers shut down the American free market for some time.
lbjv0f	6	69	The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.
lbjv0f	7	38	We were marked as market manipulators.
lbjv0f	8	24	However, we had support.
lbjv0f	9	46	By millionaires, billionaires and politicians.
lbjv0f	10	77	Soon we weren't market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.
lbjv0f	11	27	However, the HF were smart.
lbjv0f	12	52	They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative.
lbjv0f	13	76	They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets.
lbjv0f	14	66	They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze.
lbjv0f	15	69	The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV.
lbjv0f	16	91	But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it.
lbjv0f	17	56	During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.
lbjv0f	18	26	However, then Friday came.
lbjv0f	19	42	The HF started their short ladder attacks.
lbjv0f	20	44	At first we did not recognize these attacks.
lbjv0f	21	108	We didn't know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds.
lbjv0f	22	62	A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.
lbjv0f	23	44	The HF called all their quants this weekend.
lbjv0f	24	85	They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans.
lbjv0f	25	108	They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week.
lbjv0f	26	80	Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%.
lbjv0f	27	74	So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.
lbjv0f	28	35	And that's what happened on Monday.
lbjv0f	29	70	They regrouped and started the attack We lost a lot of apes on Monday.
lbjv0f	30	34	Then the second attack on Tuesday.
lbjv0f	31	27	I must say, I almost cried.
lbjv0f	32	31	A lot of people left the fight.
lbjv0f	33	123	They told their wife's boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight.
lbjv0f	34	77	At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left.
lbjv0f	35	13	Moral is low.
lbjv0f	36	69	On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response .
lbjv0f	37	27	But then the post of u DFV.
lbjv0f	38	101	After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight.
lbjv0f	39	87	He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us.
lbjv0f	40	46	The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now.
lbjv0f	41	7	Me too.
lbjv0f	42	76	DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had.
lbjv0f	43	31	Now, I will stay until the end.
lbjv0f	44	70	This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians.
lbjv0f	45	65	During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully.
lbjv0f	46	104	But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left.
lbjv0f	47	38	Only the most loyal and strong stayed.
lbjv0f	48	30	This is us now in this moment.
lbjv0f	49	52	The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands.
lbjv0f	50	55	Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF.
lbjv0f	51	39	We might die, but that does not matter.
lbjv0f	52	61	Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.
lbjv0f	53	41	BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?.
lbjv0f	54	6	Edit .
lbjv0f	55	106	Stand your grounds proudly and let your roars be long and loud to be heard from Asia to fucking Antartica.
lbjv0f	56	77	Edit 2 For the fucking retarded apes who didn't watch this masterpiece movie.
lbjv0f	57	38	The captain got hurt during the fight.
lbjv0f	58	42	He retreated with his paperhands fighters.
lbjv0f	59	109	It took a while, but he told the story of the dapper and mightly King Leonidas and his diamond hand soldiers.
lbjv0f	60	78	He came back with the greatest and largest army yet and defeated the Persians.
lbjv0f	61	30	Yes wait, our captain is Ryan.
lbjv0f	62	24	He will come to help us.
lbjv0f	63	56	He wouldnt just meme some on twitter and leave us alone.

lc9lgz	0	49	Request for DD on actually liking the stock $GME.
lc9lgz	1	22	This is all new to me.
lc9lgz	2	130	My husband and my boyfriend are a finance dude, but many of the questions I've asked have stretched their knowledge on the matter.
lc9lgz	3	108	Especially on this stock which has more to do with psychological warfare than with the F word fundamentals .
lc9lgz	4	68	After today and the announcements from GameStop it got me wondering.
lc9lgz	5	84	First, I know that at some point, Game Stop repurchased a bunch of their own shares.
lc9lgz	6	142	They knew something before most did, and that was that they were putting some real money and effort behind amping up their image and offering.
lc9lgz	7	169	I heard they closed down locations, did a sale lease deal with their warehouse locations, and even sold off the firm's jet, just in order to buy more of their own stock.
lc9lgz	8	68	So they're invested, just like we are, into the price of this stock.
lc9lgz	9	133	I believe that, because they're invested like us, they're likely to work on a strategy that would be beneficial to all of us as well.
lc9lgz	10	52	I know we can't compare ourselves to the VW squeeze.
lc9lgz	11	96	we lack the element of surprise and an instant lack of stocks to purchase the same way they did.
lc9lgz	12	8	However.
lc9lgz	13	106	what are the mechanics of if some other company came in and announced that they were had bought in to GME?
lc9lgz	14	54	Could they have done this already without our knowing?
lc9lgz	15	45	What would they have to do if they wanted to?
lc9lgz	16	85	Just seems like a decent play and I'm trying to learn more about how this shit works.
lc9lgz	17	96	What other possible plays could GameStop make which would be good for them but also good for us?
lc9lgz	18	77	Do other hedge funds have a benefit if they were to disclose their positions?
lc9lgz	19	169	If this is a war of ownership it just seems like it would be beneficial to all parties involved and bought in to disclose positions, so that we look like a united front.
lc9lgz	20	94	Combine that with some other large buy from an interested party and that could be huge, right?
lc9lgz	21	135	After hearing about the possibility of a streaming service to compete with Twitch, I became interested in actually going long with GME.
lc9lgz	22	13	Even at $325.
lc9lgz	23	241	"Not only that, but I feel like GameStop will go forward with the feeling of \"we need to justify all the faith put into us.\" I can't imagine another company that would feel as much obliged to the approval of their share holders than GameStop."
lc9lgz	24	63	Can you imagine the necessity to deliver that board must feel??
lc9lgz	25	14	They ought to.
lc9lgz	26	30	Just thoughts from a baby ape.
lc9lgz	27	139	It's been fun getting involved with the sub I'm constantly hearing my boyfriend and husband talk about when they're jerking each other off.
lc9lgz	28	37	Thanks for humoring an annoying noob.
lc9lgz	29	77	At the very least, I'll always know that I'm not a fucking paper hands bitch.
lc9lgz	30	98	FTR, in the week since I've put $25k into GME, I've gotten another $6.5k in payments in real life.
lc9lgz	31	77	There are real life lessons to be learned from not being a paper hands bitch.
lc9lgz	32	53	I'm a better, ballsier businesswoman after this week.
lc9lgz	33	149	I love hanging out with you fucking retards and I'm looking forward to posting many future loss gain porns which will be completely unrelated to GME.
lc9lgz	34	34	Edit WTF is going on with the sub?
lc9lgz	35	59	I'm getting emails about comments which are not showing up.

lc8sqz	0	12	DO NOT SELL.
lc8sqz	1	37	Why GME is going to $1000 next week!.
lc8sqz	2	98	First of all if you are reading this post and do not own any GME stock, go and buy some right now.
lc8sqz	3	106	Ok, now that that is taken care of, I have done some thinking and have discovered some interesting things.
lc8sqz	4	121	I will list 3 reasons why GME is not over, and why this is actually going to shoot to new records this week or next week.
lc8sqz	5	164	TLDR GME is going to 800 1000 by next week because all the bitch paper handers are out, there is also a possibility of a second short squeeze happening any day now.
lc8sqz	6	100	The other day when GME fell 60%, the volume for that day did not even pass the average daily volume.
lc8sqz	7	131	Yes let me repeat that, when the stock went down 60%, there was so little amount of sellers, we did not even pass the daily volume.
lc8sqz	8	173	This means that the people who are paper hand bitches have already sold, because if GME goes down 60% and you haven't sold, good news for you, you are a diamond hand baller.
lc8sqz	9	34	Now this leads to my second point.
lc8sqz	10	110	So that the only people left holding GME are the diamond hand chads, it will be really hard to get us to sell.
lc8sqz	11	81	If anything this dip has been a blessing to allow us to grab more stock at cheap.
lc8sqz	12	56	We have held the ground of around $100 or a good 2 days.
lc8sqz	13	83	If you do not know, GME was way below that at the beginning of its new found value.
lc8sqz	14	147	The short percentage is still super high, even though the old shorts may be out, there are now new shorts that think this thing is going back down.
lc8sqz	15	95	But once they realize that won't happen, they will stop risking it and just buy back the stock.
lc8sqz	16	94	Now this is what can kickstart the next short squeeze which I think can easily go to 800 1000.
lc8sqz	17	45	Now if those two reasons weren't good enough.
lc8sqz	18	98	Gamestop has hired new executives and professionals to the company from very successful companies.
lc8sqz	19	94	This means that they are not letting this opportunity go to waste and make some money from it.
lc8sqz	20	98	And remember, a company is worth however much the people who buy the stock believe it is worth at.

lc8b2x	0	81	What I think is happening w GME is that the shorts have already made their money.
lc8b2x	1	134	I don't know nothing about nothing, but everyday we get these crazy swings where GME hits sub $90 for a bit then goes up to mid $120 .
lc8b2x	2	212	What if the shorts were able to source together more money so that they buy those dips in large amounts and sell at the top then do some market stuff short ladder, straight trading, etc to make the price go down?
lc8b2x	3	83	Like what if they're all in on us and just take turns making money on those trades.
lc8b2x	4	130	It's like they're messing with us and profiting off these dips and purposely keeping it within reach to give us a glimpse of hope.

lc7ydx	4	25	but what's the deal here?
lc7ydx	5	246	I have a sinking suspicion that it's a distraction being propagated by WSB clones hoping for something that doesn't have a chance of really blowing up, and now the bots and trolls are desperately trying to pump it up to further distract from GME.

lc7ek6	0	179	New to Stonks, but is it useful to know Root, Inc ROOT seems to be in a pattern of jacking up insurance rates and driving out customers as their stream of investment money slows?.
lc7ek6	1	179	In case you didn't know Root, Inc ROOT has been consistently ramping up their rates at a seemingly exponential rate over the last three years as they burn through investor rounds.
lc7ek6	2	111	They launched by offering absurdly low rates anywhere they could and pour money gasoline onto a marketing fire.
lc7ek6	3	72	At this point their customer acquisition seems to have jumped the shark.
lc7ek6	4	77	You can see it immediately by dipping into the Root Car Insurance subreddit .
lc7ek6	5	137	As a pandemic drags on and people drive less I think Root is too small a player to eat the costs of people dropping or lowering policies.
lc7ek6	6	133	I guess this post is half to throw my perception spaghetti at the wall and the other half is to ask if such insights ever have value?

lc7905	12	91	You didn't need those economics or finance classes in school, you're buying a lambo anyway.
lc7905	13	147	4. Then complain about your losses to the same Facebook group because you didn't know what a stop limit was or when was the right time to pull out.
lc7905	14	116	5. Become cynical and bitter about any stock, that anyone mentions, but continue to not understand market mechanics.

lc6wra	4	198	They're trading at extraordinarily low values $.07 per share , which is why I am able to purchase larger share amounts, hoping that upon federal decriminalization these securities values will spike.

lc68f5	2	41	Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains.
lc68f5	3	87	While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous WATT .
lc68f5	4	86	They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over the air wireless charging.
lc68f5	5	151	Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.
lc68f5	6	143	Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications .
lc68f5	7	39	drones, medical devices, laptops, etc..
lc68f5	8	177	They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.
lc68f5	9	50	FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.
lc68f5	10	143	They also have the first FCC permitted non beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021.
lc68f5	11	81	Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at the market equity offering.
lc68f5	12	138	This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront.
lc68f5	13	59	Currently shares are at 3.5 from an all time high of 22.44.

lc4boy	0	12	Canoo GOEV .
lc4boy	1	33	Ok here is my first shot at a DD.
lc4boy	2	60	I've been eyeing this company Canoo GOEV for a little while.
lc4boy	3	38	I'm long 1200 shares a cost of $15.28.
lc4boy	4	77	Canoo is a new EV start up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service.
lc4boy	5	101	From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years.
lc4boy	6	158	That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc..
lc4boy	7	6	Link .
lc4boy	8	153	Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625 mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas powered car at $750 916 mon.
lc4boy	9	59	It has a barrier of entry because there is no down payment.
lc4boy	10	53	I don't know how that will play out with most people.
lc4boy	11	163	I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance.
lc4boy	12	138	Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low maintenance fleet of vehicles.
lc4boy	13	74	I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.
lc4boy	14	103	"What I like most about this company is their \"skateboard\" platform which is the bottom half of the car."
lc4boy	15	81	From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard.
lc4boy	16	234	Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.
lc4boy	17	6	Link .
lc4boy	18	80	It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down.
lc4boy	19	132	Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform.
lc4boy	20	64	Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.
lc4boy	21	122	Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long term hold for me.
lc4boy	22	87	Canoo GOEV currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all time high at $22.30 in December.
lc4boy	23	93	So, it hasn't had a crazy break out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch.

lc15r6	0	56	Don't trade on margin if you want to have diamond hands.
lc15r6	1	73	Margin is alluring because it gives you control of money you do not have.
lc15r6	2	200	But keep in mind that you are borrowing money from your broker with interest, and the broker will liquidate your position if you fall below a threshold, e.g., 33%, 50%, etc., depending on your broker.
lc15r6	3	179	If you are margin called, some brokers will call you and give you time to add additional funds which you may not have or liquidate your positions before they are force liquidated.
lc15r6	4	126	However, if you look into the contractual language between you and your broker, they are NOT obligated to give you a heads up.
lc15r6	5	216	Moreover, given that they are likely bombarded right now, and probably have an incentive to liquidate your positions, they are mostly likely allowed to manually liquidate your position, e.g., your GME long positions.
lc15r6	6	78	You cannot diamond hand a position that is manually liquidated by your broker.
lc15r6	7	59	Some of you may say that you cant even go on margin on GME.
lc15r6	8	30	That is true for some brokers.
lc15r6	9	78	If you want to trade GME, don't go on margin trying to trade any other equity.
lc15r6	10	61	Do not give your broker a chance to liquidate your positions.
