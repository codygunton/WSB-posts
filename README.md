# WSB-posts

🏗 Under construction 🏗

Analysis of Wall Street Bets posts (dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-wallstreetsbets-post). I aim to go beyond direct sentiment analysis, to better understand the evolution of topics within the WSB sphere.

✔: Fast SparkNLP pipelines for topic modeling with emojis, and with n-gram extraction using POS tagging. [Demo here](./notebooks/lda_pipelines.ipynb).


Current work: embedding using Tensorflow and clustering for domain segmentation.

Next: Futher dimensionality reduction and time series analysis.
