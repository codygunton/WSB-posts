The biggest funds know this too, and being the biggest funds, they have access to way more leverage than you and I do. This is a bit of a problem for shorts though: shorts need liquid capital to _close_ their positions. If you've ever been in a situation where you sold a covered call or spread and got money for it and then immediately used that money to buy another call or something, but then you wanted to buy your spread or your covered call back, but couldn't close it because you just spent the money on something else....now you know what is going on at these hedge funds. They collected a bunch of money a long time ago when they shorted the stonk, and then immediately spent all that money to juice their returns, and now they need to have a fire sale just to have enough liquid capital to buy back their shit at a massive premium.\n",

So they're happy to take it as collateral. But right now, some stocks are going up and down by 100%+ within minutes.

If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n",

      "\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n",

WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.

      "\\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n",

Victoria's Secret, as seasoned Jeffrey Epstein gumshoes will know, was founded by one [Leslie Wexner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Wexner), who had a very troubling relationship with Epstein. Epstein was Wexner's personal money manager and Wexner was Epstein's only known client. Wexner and Epstein were so close that [Wexner gave Epstein a mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/) in 2011, years after it was already known that he was a pedophile creep. Epstein would tell the girls he was sexually assaulting that he was a [modeling scout for Victoria's Secret](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/). [Jean-Luc Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Brunel), another Epstein-associated \"modeling scout\" and sex criminal who was [recently arrested in France](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/modeling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-charged-rape-minor-jeffrey-epstein-n1251804), would supply models to Victoria's Secret through his agency MC2 Model Management. Basically, what I'm saying is that Melvin Capital, and now Citadel by extension, are long sex trafficking pedophiles.\n",

    "## Takeaways:\n",
    "  - most sentences are < 30 lines long (and even < 15?).\n",
    "  - some people just write enormously long run-on sentences.\n",
    "  - really short senteces often seem worth keeping (e.g., \"HOLD\" etc).\n",
    "  - Could try to disambiguate stock names as in \"GME\" |-> \"The publicly-traded stock GME\".\n",
    "  - Could concatenate sentences to aim for sentences around some length.\n",
    "  - Could do two layers of sentence splitting: one for paragraphs and one for splitting long paragraphs.\n",
    "  - the style \"Exemplified. Here. By. This. String.\" could be handled as a special case? Probably not worth it.\n",
    "  \n",
    " To do\n",
    "  - ✓ check on quotation escaping.\n",
    "  - ✓ split sentences on linebreaks (so keep these in DocumentNormalizer)\n",
    "  - ✓ split sentenceson -'s\n",
    "  - look again at asterisks.\n",
    "  - ✓ improve ellipsis handling.\n"

PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He's  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.

Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can't, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that's because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.

Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n",

WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.

Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n",
