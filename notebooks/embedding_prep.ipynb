This is a bit of a problem for shorts though: shorts need liquid capital to _close_ their positions. If you've ever been in a situation where you sold a covered call or spread and got money for it and then immediately used that money to buy another call or something, but then you wanted to buy your spread or your covered call back, but couldn't close it because you just spent the money on something else....now you know what is going on at these hedge funds. They collected a bunch of money a long time ago when they shorted the stonk, and then immediately spent all that money to juice their returns, and now they need to have a fire sale just to have enough liquid capital to buy back their shit at a massive premium.\n",

Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.

WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?

Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n",

Victoria's Secret, as seasoned Jeffrey Epstein gumshoes will know, was founded by one [Leslie Wexner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Wexner), who had a very troubling relationship with Epstein. Epstein was Wexner's personal money manager and Wexner was Epstein's only known client. Wexner and Epstein were so close that [Wexner gave Epstein a mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/) in 2011, years after it was already known that he was a pedophile creep. Epstein would tell the girls he was sexually assaulting that he was a [modeling scout for Victoria's Secret](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/). [Jean-Luc Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Brunel), another Epstein-associated \"modeling scout\" and sex criminal who was [recently arrested in France](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/modeling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-charged-rape-minor-jeffrey-epstein-n1251804), would supply models to Victoria's Secret through his agency MC2 Model Management. Basically, what I'm saying is that Melvin Capital, and now Citadel by extension, are long sex trafficking pedophiles.\n",
